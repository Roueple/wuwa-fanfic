# Havoc Resonation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Havoc, meaning "Annihilation", is the ability to annihilate matter. It represents darkness and destruction-based abilities and is one of the six elemental attributes in Wuthering Waves. Havoc resonators excel at dealing massive damage through matter manipulation and dark energy.

## Core Mechanics

### Elemental Properties
- **Element Type**: Dark/Chaos/Matter annihilation
- **Primary Role**: Main DPS/High damage output
- **Damage Type**: Havoc damage (dark-based)
- **Status Effect**: Havoc Bane

### Havoc Bane Effect
Some Havoc attacks will apply a stackable "Havoc Bane Effect" to the target. While "Havoc Bane Effect" lasts, the number of its stacks is automatically increased by 1 periodically.

Key characteristics:
- "Havoc Bane Effect" can stack up to 2 times
- When it is stacked to its max, all stacks will be removed to deal Havoc DMG to the target
- Applies "Havoc Bane Effect" to surrounding Characters after max stack explosion
- Dodge attacks to avoid the spreading of "Havoc Bane Effect" among teammates

## Combat Applications

### Damage Mechanics
- High burst damage potential
- Matter annihilation effects
- Area damage through Bane spreading
- Dark Surge state for enhanced combat

### Strategic Use
1. **Stack Building**: Automatic stack increase over time
2. **Explosion Timing**: Managing 2-stack limit for maximum damage
3. **Area Control**: Using Bane spread for multi-target damage
4. **Enhanced States**: Utilizing transformation mechanics

## Resonator Examples

### Rover (Havoc)
Rover (Havoc) is a free character that can be unlocked after completing the Main Quest called Grand Warstorm in Act VI. You have to be at Union Level 21 to unlock and start this quest.

Key abilities:
- **Dark Surge State**: Enhanced state when Forte Gauge is charged
- All normal attacks and Resonance Skill enhanced during Dark Surge
- Can extend Dark Surge state using Resonance Skill
- Outro Skill summons a Havoc Field, dealing Havoc DMG to all targets within its range

Performance comparison:
- With all things considered, Havoc Rover is by far the better of the two attributes. The raw damage potential that Havoc Rover has can rival even the characters that we get from banners - and we can get this unit for free!

## Team Compositions

### Mono-Havoc Teams
- Some Resonators like Danjin and Aalto have Outro Skills that increase the elemental damage (Amplified) of the next character you swap into combat
- Danjin's Outro Skill makes it so that the incoming Resonator's Havoc DMG is buffed by 23 seconds
- Effects like Danjin's allow for mono-elemental teams to work

### Damage-Focused Teams
- Pair with buffers like Shorekeeper and Roccia
- Utilize team compositions that maximize Dark Surge uptime
- Focus on characters that enhance Havoc damage output

## Echo Sets and Equipment

### Recommended Echo Sets
- **Sun-Sinking Eclipse**: Strengthens Havoc damage
- Focus on ATK and CRIT stats for maximum damage
- Prioritize sets that enhance burst damage

### Weapon Recommendations
For Rover (Havoc):
- Emerald of Genesis is the Havoc Rover's best weapon since it provides them CRIT Rate and a high base ATK
- Commando of Conviction increases ATK when using Intro Skill
- Build focuses on typical Main DPS stats

## Special Mechanics

### Dark Surge State
- Activated when Forte Circuit gauge is full
- Use Heavy Attack: Devastation to enter
- Enhanced normal attacks and Resonance Skill
- Goal is to land as many combos as possible
- Can extend duration with strategic skill usage

### Havoc Field
- Rover (Havoc)'s Outro Skill creates damaging field
- Continuous area damage to enemies
- Different from Spectro's stasis field
- Offensive rather than utility-focused

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **Highest Damage Potential**: The raw damage potential that Havoc Rover has can rival even the characters that we get from banners
- **Free Accessibility**: Available through story progression
- **Enhanced State**: Unique Dark Surge transformation
- **Area Damage**: Effective multi-target capabilities
- **Self-Sufficient**: Strong standalone damage without reactions

### Disadvantages
- **Story Locked**: Locked behind the Main Quest Line
- **No Carryover**: Their Fortes and Resonance Chain aren't carried over if you upgrade their Spectro version
- **Limited Enablers**: Fewer support options compared to other elements
- **High Field Time**: Requires extended on-field presence

## Advanced Strategies

### Rotation Optimization
1. Start with Resonance Skill for immediate Umbra gain
2. Build Forte Circuit gauge efficiently
3. Enter Dark Surge at optimal timing
4. Maximize combo chains during enhanced state
5. Use Resonance Liberation with Dreamless Echo for maximum damage

### Combat Combos
- **Switch-in Combo**: Resonance Skill → Echo ability
- **Gauge Building**: Heavy Attack → Two Basic Attacks
- **Dark Surge Rotation**: Full Basic Attack chain → Resonance Skill extension
- **Ultimate Timing**: Use with Dreamless Echo within 50 seconds

## Interaction with Other Elements

### Elemental Resistance
- The Havoc Prism is immune to Havoc DMG
- Avoid using against Havoc-resistant enemies
- No elemental reactions but highest raw damage

### Enemy Mechanics
- The Havoc Prism provides a buff for surrounding enemies, which allows them to deplete Resonators' Resonance Energy with their attacks
- Can be absorbed by certain enemies for permanent effects
- Strategic target prioritization needed

## Damage Calculations

### Havoc Damage Bonuses
- Dealing DMG inflicts 1 stack of Havoc Bane on the target. This effect can be triggered once every 6s
- Havoc represents the corrupting influence of the Havoc element
- Scales with ATK, CRIT, and Havoc DMG bonus stats

## Future Potential
- Additional Havoc resonators may expand team options
- Potential for more Havoc damage amplifiers
- Enhanced Dark Surge mechanics
- Expanded matter annihilation effects

## Conclusion
Havoc resonation represents the pinnacle of raw damage potential in Wuthering Waves. Its focus on matter annihilation and dark energy manipulation creates a unique playstyle centered around transformation states and massive burst damage. While it lacks the utility of other elements and doesn't participate in elemental reactions, its sheer damage output and free accessibility make it an excellent choice for players seeking a powerful main DPS option. The Dark Surge mechanic adds depth to combat, rewarding skilled play with devastating damage potential.
