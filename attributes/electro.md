# Electro Resonation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Electro is the ability to displace charges. It represents lightning and electricity-based abilities and is one of the six elemental attributes in Wuthering Waves. Electro resonators excel in dealing multi-target damage through chain reactions and energy-based attacks.

## Core Mechanics

### Elemental Properties
- **Element Type**: Lightning/Electrical charge manipulation
- **Primary Role**: Multi-target damage and energy management
- **Damage Type**: Electro damage (lightning-based)
- **Status Effect**: Electro Flare

### Electro Flare Effect
Electro Flare is the status effect linked to the Electro element.

Key characteristics:
- Lowers the target's ATK, with the reduction becoming more severe as stacks increase
- Stackable debuff system
- To counter Electro Flare, focus on maintaining offensive pressure while being prepared to dodge frequently to prevent stack accumulation

## Combat Applications

### Chain Lightning Mechanics
- Often associated with chain reactions
- Lightning effects that can jump between targets
- Energy-based attacks
- Multi-target damage specialization

### Strategic Use
1. **Chain Positioning**: Optimizing enemy placement for chains
2. **Energy Management**: Balancing resource generation and consumption
3. **Debuff Application**: ATK reduction through Flare stacks
4. **Burst Windows**: Timing electrical discharges
