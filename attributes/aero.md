# Aero Resonation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Aero is the ability to manipulate airflow. It represents wind-based abilities and is one of the six elemental attributes in Wuthering Waves. Aero resonators focus on agility, rapid strikes, and enhanced mobility while providing crowd control through air manipulation.

## Core Mechanics

### Elemental Properties
- **Element Type**: Wind/Air manipulation
- **Primary Role**: Mobility and rapid strikes

### Aero Erosion Effect
Aero Erosion: Applies Aero damage over time, with higher stacks increasing the damage output.

Key characteristics:
- Damage over time effect
- Stackable for increased damage
- Players facing enemies that can inflict Aero Erosion should prioritize evasive maneuvers to minimize its impact and prevent stack buildup

## Resonance Spectrum Patterns

### Natural Alignments
According to lore, Aero resonators have unique spectrum patterns:
- Aalto's Resonance Spectrum Pattern matches the pattern of fog
