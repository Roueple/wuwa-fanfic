# Glacio Resonation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Glacio, meaning "Condensation", is the ability to cool down and freeze. It represents ice-based abilities and is one of the six elemental attributes in Wuthering Waves. Glacio resonators specialize in control and crowd management through freezing mechanics.

## Core Mechanics

### Elemental Properties
- **Element Type**: Ice/Frost manipulation
- **Primary Role**: Crowd control and area denial
- **Damage Type**: Glacio damage (ice-based)
- **Status Effect**: Glacio Chafe (Frost Chafe)

### Glacio Chafe Effect
Some Glacio attacks will apply a stackable "Frost Chafe Effect" to the target.

Key characteristics:
- Each stack of "Frost Chafe Effect" reduces the target's movement speed
- When "Frost Chafe Effect" is stacked to its max, the target will be frozen
- All stacks of "Frost Chafe Effect" will be removed upon freezing
- Struggle to accelerate your recovery from the frozen state
- Gradually decreases the target's movement speed

## Combat Applications

### Control Mechanics
- Movement speed reduction through Chafe stacks
- Complete immobilization through freezing
- Area control for tactical advantage
- Creating openings for team damage

### Strategic Use
1. **Stack Building**: Progressive movement reduction
2. **Freeze Timing**: Managing stacks for optimal freezing
3. **Team Coordination**: Creating damage windows for allies
4. **Battlefield Control**: Limiting enemy mobility

## Special Enemy Mechanics

### Glacio Prism
The Glacio Prism is immune to Glacio DMG. It provides a buff for surrounding enemies, which grant them Super Armor (their moves won't be interrupted when hit).

Additional properties:
- Can be absorbed by Cyan-Feathered Herons and Violet-Feathered Herons
- Provides permanent Super Armor state after absorption
- Strategic priority target in encounters

## Team Compositions

### Control-Focused Teams
- Glacio-based teams can excel in controlling the battlefield
- Creating opportunities for other characters to deal massive damage to immobilized foes
- Pair with high-damage dealers from other elements

### Support Synergies
- Combine with characters who benefit from stationary targets
- Works well with AoE damage dealers
- Enhances team safety through crowd control

## Echo Sets and Equipment

### Recommended Echo Sets
- **Freezing Frost**: Enhances Glacio damage
- Focus on effect duration and stack buildup
- Consider control-enhancing substats

### Build Priorities
- Effect application rate
- Glacio damage bonuses
- Energy recharge for skill uptime
- Defensive stats for survivability

## Combat Strategies

### Crowd Management
- Prioritize dangerous enemies for freezing
- Maintain Chafe on multiple targets
- Coordinate freezes with team burst windows
- Use slows for kiting strategies

### Defensive Applications
- Interrupt enemy attack patterns
- Create safe zones through freezing
- Protect allies during critical moments
- Control battlefield positioning

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **Superior Control**: Specializing in control and crowd management
- **Team Enabler**: Creating openings for additional attacks
- **Defensive Utility**: Can slow or freeze opponents
- **Battlefield Manipulation**: Excellent area control
- **Safety Enhancement**: Reduces incoming damage through control

### Disadvantages
- **Immune Enemies**: The Glacio Prism is immune to Glacio DMG
- **Resistance Issues**: High resistance from Glacio enemies
- **Lower Damage**: Less burst potential than offensive elements
- **Stack Requirements**: Time needed to build freeze stacks
- **Limited Solo Power**: Relies on team for damage

## Advanced Mechanics

### Freeze Optimization
1. Understanding stack thresholds
2. Timing freezes for burst phases
3. Managing multiple frozen targets
4. Chafe spread strategies

### Ability Interactions
- Dealing DMG inflicts 1 stack of Glacio Chafe on the target. This effect can be triggered once every 6s
- Stack management across multiple enemies
- Freeze duration maximization
- Combo potential with other elements

## Interaction with Other Elements

### Elemental Resistance
- Glacio enemies resist ice damage significantly
- Some bosses have extreme Glacio resistance
- Avoid using against Glacio Prisms

### Team Synergies
- Excellent with burst damage dealers
- Pairs well with AoE specialists
- Enhances team survivability
- No negative interactions with other elements

## Tactical Applications

### Boss Encounters
- Interrupt dangerous attack patterns
- Create damage windows during freezes
- Manage adds through crowd control
- Provide team breathing room

### Mob Control
- Mass freezing capabilities
- Progressive slowdown of groups
- Safe clearing strategies
- Efficient crowd management

## Special Considerations

### Enemy Adaptations
- Some enemies gain Super Armor from Glacio Prisms
- Frozen enemies can struggle to break free faster
- Dodge attacks to avoid the accumulation of "Frost Chafe Effect" stacks
- Certain enemies may be freeze-immune

### Environmental Factors
- Enhanced effectiveness in certain Tacet Fields
- Glacio-favored challenge modifiers
- Synergy with environmental hazards

## Build Variations

### Full Control Build
- Maximum freeze duration
- Rapid stack application
- Wide area coverage
- Defensive substats

### Hybrid Damage Build
- Balance between control and damage
- Glacio damage optimization
- Maintain control utility
- Offensive stat focus

## Future Potential
Based on speculation about element roles:
- Current Rover has Aero (Healer), Havoc (Main DPS) and Spectro (Sub DPS). My take is the 3 remaining elements would be Glacio for Healer
- Potential for Glacio healers combining control and support
- Enhanced freeze mechanics
- New crowd control innovations

## Defensive Strategies

### Team Protection
- Freeze priority targets
- Create safe zones for allies
- Interrupt enemy combos
- Manage battlefield tempo

### Survival Tactics
- Self-peeling through freezes
- Kiting with slow effects
- Emergency crowd control
- Defensive positioning

## Conclusion
Glacio resonation represents the tactical control aspect of Wuthering Waves combat. Its focus on crowd management and battlefield manipulation makes it invaluable for team compositions seeking safety and control. While it may lack the raw damage of offensive elements, its ability to completely shut down enemies through freezing creates unique strategic opportunities. The progressive nature of Glacio Chafe allows for both immediate slows and eventual hard control, making it versatile in various combat scenarios. For players who enjoy tactical gameplay and enabling their teammates, Glacio offers a rewarding and impactful playstyle.
