## The Lament - Core Mechanics and Reality Effects

### Fundamental Nature
- **Definition**: Catastrophic mass-extinction phenomena affecting Solaris-3 for 10,000+ years
- **Frequency**: 5 global occurrences, 300,000+ regional events
- **Physics Impact**: All fundamental laws except gravity have been altered
- **Reality Distortion**: Creates Waveworn Phenomena and Tacet Fields
- **Temporal Effects**: Disrupts linear time flow, creates temporal anomalies

### Detailed Lament Mechanics

#### Reality Alteration Process
1. **Initial Frequency Disruption**: Chaotic energy waves destabilize local physics
2. **Cascade Effect**: Disruption spreads through resonance connections
3. **Law Breakdown**: Fundamental forces (except gravity) become unreliable
4. **Echo Formation**: Past events and emotions crystallize into persistent phenomena
5. **Stabilization Phase**: New unstable equilibrium establishes temporary "normal"

#### Time Distortion Effects
- **Temporal Loops**: Events repeat in affected areas, trapping consciousness
- **Time Dilation**: Hours can pass as minutes or stretch into subjective days
- **Memory Bleeding**: Past and present experiences overlap and merge
- **Causal Disruption**: Effect can precede cause in Lament-affected zones
- **Chronological Anchoring**: Strong emotional events create temporal stability points

#### Reality Manipulation Mechanics
- **Frequency Resonance**: All matter vibrates at specific frequencies that can be altered
- **Harmonic Interference**: Conflicting frequencies create reality distortions
- **Resonance Amplification**: Strong emotions or memories can stabilize or destabilize areas
- **Echo Manifestation**: Sufficient resonance can make past events temporarily real
- **Reality Anchoring**: Powerful Resonators can impose stability through force of will

### Lament Manifestations
- **Tacet Discords**: Sentient beings formed from chaotic frequency energy
- **Echo Phenomena**: Manifestations of past events, beings, or emotions

- **Temporal Loops**: Repeating time segments in affected areas
- **Memory Crystals**: Physical manifestations of traumatic experiences
- **Phantom Zones**: Areas where the dead appear to still live
- **Resonance Vortexes**: Swirling energy that can transport matter across space/time

### How the Lament Affects Daily Life

#### Immediate Physical Effects

#### Psychological Impact
- **Chronic Anxiety**: Constant threat creates persistent stress in population
- **Temporal Disorientation**: Time distortions cause mental health issues
- **Reality Dissociation**: Difficulty distinguishing real from Lament-induced phenomena
- **Collective Trauma**: Shared experience of repeated catastrophes shapes culture
- **Adaptive Resilience**: Survivors develop extraordinary mental flexibility

### Lament Progression Timeline
