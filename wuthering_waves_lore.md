## World Overview

**Wuthering Waves** is set in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world on the planet **Solaris-3**. The world has been fundamentally altered by a series of catastrophic events known as **The Lament**, which wiped out most of humanity and caused the fundamental laws of physics to become unstable.

### Key Setting Elements:
- **Planet**: Solaris-3
- **Time Period**: Post-apocalyptic future (exact timeline unclear)
- **World State**: Recovering civilization after multiple extinction events
- **Technology Level**: Advanced, but constrained by altered physics
- **Population**: Sparse human settlements, adapted survivors

---

## Core Concepts & Terminology

### Solaris-3
The planet on which Wuthering Waves takes place. Once a thriving world, it has been repeatedly devastated by The Lament events over the past 10,000 years.

### The Lament (悲鸣)
- **Definition**: A series of catastrophic mass-extinction phenomena that have affected Solaris-3
- **Frequency**: 5 global occurrences and over 300,000 regional occurrences in the past 10,000 years
- **Effects**: 
  - Disruption of fundamental laws of physics (except gravity)
  - Mass extinction events
  - Creation of Waveworn Phenomena
  - Spawning of Tacet Discords
  - Halting of space exploration due to warped physics

### Waveworn Phenomenon
Anomalous occurrences resulting from the destabilization of natural laws during The Lament. These phenomena are ongoing effects that continue to affect the world.

### Tacet Field
Zones affected by Waveworn Phenomena where the laws of physics behave abnormally.

---

## Waveworn Phenomena

The Waveworn Phenomena are the ongoing effects of The Lament that continue to affect Solaris-3. These include:

- **Physics Distortion**: All fundamental laws except gravity have been altered
- **Energy Anomalies**: Chaotic frequency energy that creates various effects
- **Environmental Changes**: Altered landscapes and atmospheric conditions
- **Biological Mutations**: Changes in flora, fauna, and potentially humans

---

## Beings and Entities

### Humans
The surviving population of Solaris-3, greatly reduced by The Lament events. Humanity has adapted to the new world conditions and rebuilt civilization over time.

### Resonators
- **Definition**: Humans who possess special abilities that emerged after The Lament
- **Origin Theory**: Possibly triggered by mutations or awakened dormant abilities due to Lament anomalies
- **Abilities**: Can absorb and control Tacet Discords, use special powers
- **Classification**: Divided into 4-star and 5-star rarities based on power level
- **Combat Role**: Primary defenders against Tacet Discords

### Tacet Discords (TDs)
- **Definition**: Sentient beings formed by residual chaotic frequency energy under Waveworn Phenomena
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Ever-changing, amorphous forms
  - Possess Tacet Cores (Sound Nucleus/Reverberation Bodies)
  - Created from chaotic energy left by The Lament
- **Threat Level**: Primary antagonistic force threatening humanity
- **Relationship to Resonators**: Can be absorbed/controlled by Resonators

### Echoes
Entities or manifestations related to Tacet Discords that can be utilized by Resonators. The exact nature and relationship requires further clarification.

### Sentinels
Powerful entities in the Wuthering Waves universe. Specific details about their nature and role need additional research.

### Threnodians
Another category of beings in the world. Further details on their characteristics and role are needed.

## Technology and Materials

### Tacetite
- **Definition**: A rare substance discovered during Waveworn Phenomena studies
- **Properties**: Can permanently contain Remnant Energy
- **Uses**: Crafting weapons for Resonators to use against Tacet Discords
- **Availability**: Found within Tacet Fields and areas affected by Waveworn Phenomena

### Remnant Energy
Energy associated with the aftereffects of The Lament, which can be contained using Tacetite.

### Reverberation
Related to the echo/frequency-based nature of the world's altered physics and Tacet Discord manifestation.

## Regions and Geography

### Huanglong
- **Type**: Fortified city region
- **Description**: One of the main populated areas where humanity has rebuilt
- **Notable Features**: Defensive structures, organized society

### Rinascita

- **Frequency and Resonance**: Sound/vibration-based metaphysics underlying the world
- **Cycles of Destruction and Renewal**: The ongoing pattern of Lament events

### World Constraints for Canon Accuracy
- **Physics Laws**: Only gravity remains unchanged; all other physical laws are altered
- **Technology Limitations**: Space exploration halted due to warped physics
- **Population Density**: Humanity is sparse, concentrated in fortified settlements  
- **Power Systems**: Resonator abilities are linked to Tacet Discord interaction
- **Material Science**: Tacetite is crucial for anti-Tacet Discord technology

---

## Notes for Fanfiction Writers

### Canon Compliance Guidelines
1. **Respect the 10,000-year timeline** of Lament events
2. **Maintain the physics alteration concept** - gravity works, other laws don't
3. **Keep Resonator powers tied to Tacet Discord interaction**
4. **Remember the post-apocalyptic setting** - civilization is rebuilt, not original
5. **Honor the frequency/sound-based metaphysics** evident in terminology

### Areas Requiring Additional Research
- Detailed character backstories and relationships
- Specific regional histories and cultures
- Complete organizational structures and hierarchies
- Exact mechanics of Resonator powers
- Detailed timeline of historical events
- Complete bestiary of Tacet Discord types
- Full technological capabilities and limitations

### Flexible Elements for Creative Writing
- Personal character histories (within timeline constraints)
- Regional variations in culture and society
- New Tacet Discord types (following established rules)
- Exploration of unexplored regions
- Character relationship dynamics
- Individual Resonator power expressions
