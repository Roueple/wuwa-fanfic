# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This fanfiction follows Caspian, a reincarnated office worker who retains his past life memories and is reborn in the Wuthering Waves world. The story focuses on his relationship with Phrolova, exploring themes of trauma, survival, and the tension between wanting ordinary life and being drawn into extraordinary circumstances. The narrative style follows Korean webnovel conventions with heavy internal monologue, self-deprecating humor, and genre awareness.

The story is structured in arcs, with Arc 1 serving as the foundation (Prologue + 5 chapters, ~15,000-20,000 words total) that establishes the characters, their relationship, and sets up future developments.
