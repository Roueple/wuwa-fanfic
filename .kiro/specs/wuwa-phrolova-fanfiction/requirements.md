# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This fanfiction follows Caspian, a reincarnated office worker who retains his past life memories and is reborn in the Wuthering Waves world (Solaris-3). The story focuses on his relationship with Phrolova, exploring themes of trauma, survival, and the tension between wanting ordinary life and being drawn into extraordinary circumstances. The narrative style follows Korean webnovel conventions with heavy internal monologue, self-deprecating humor, and balanced composition of thought, talk, and story elements.

**Critical Context**: Caspian doesn't know this is the WuWa world - he never played the game, only heard of it as "Genshin killer." He has no future knowledge or insider information, just generic isekai expectations that fail him. The world name "Solaris-3" was learned naturally from adults.

**Key Characters in Ostina**: Phrolova (survivor), plus canon WuWa characters: Betty, Triss, Noemie, Leah (Granny Leah - kind but strict), Searle, Pierce, Luneau (young man with dark blue hair, 5-10 years older than MC/Phrolova), Aeschylus (old man with white hair and white beard). Triss is born when MC/Phrolova are 10. All canon villagers die in the Lament event - only Phrolova and Caspian survive.

**Timeline**: 500 years after initial Lament = 10k regional laments + 5 global laments (world is insanely dangerous). Phrolova's power awakening happens at age 16 when Lament fragment drops in Ostina. MC's power awakening should happen during merchant travel, NOT in Ostina.

**Family Background**: Marcus (father) is wool processor, family becomes merchants later. This progression makes logical sense for merchant trade development.

The story is structured in arcs, with Arc 1 serving as the foundation (Prologue + 11-12 chapters total) that establishes the characters, their relationship, and sets up future developments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Character Foundation and Development
