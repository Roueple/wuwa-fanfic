- [ ] Is she maintaining her core melancholic nature while showing growth?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### Speech Pattern Errors
- **Too Modern**: She should maintain archaic, formal speech patterns
- **Not Poetic Enough**: Every line should carry emotional/metaphorical weight
- **Inconsistent Tone**: Track whether she's in melancholic, fierce, or yandere mode
- **Missing Musical References**: Her background should influence her language

#### Character Development Errors
- **Yandere Too Fast**: Her possessiveness should develop gradually
- **Losing Core Traits**: She should always maintain her melancholic, poetic nature
- **Forgetting Immortality**: Her Threnodian nature affects her perspective
- **Inconsistent Obsession**: Track whether she's focused on villagers or Kael

#### Relationship Errors
- **Pure Villain**: Even at yandere peak, her love for Kael should be genuine
- **Losing Agency**: She should be an equal partner, not dependent
- **Forgetting Past**: Her village tragedy should always influence her actions
- **Missing Growth**: She should show development from pure grief to hope
