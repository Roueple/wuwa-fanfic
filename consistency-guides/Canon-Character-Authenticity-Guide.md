# Canon Character Authenticity Guide
## Maintaining Original WuWa Character Personalities

### Core Principle
All canon characters from Wuthering Waves must maintain their established personalities, speech patterns, and motivations exactly as they appear in the original game. They should react authentically to the fanfiction's events while staying true to their core characterization.
