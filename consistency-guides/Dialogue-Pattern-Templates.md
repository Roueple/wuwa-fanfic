## Kael Dialogue Templates

### Internal Monologue Patterns

#### Analytical Problem-Solving
```
Template: "Okay, let me think this through. [Problem statement]. If [condition A], then [logical consequence]. But if [condition B], then [alternative outcome]. The smart move would be [logical choice], but [emotional consideration] makes it complicated."

Example: "Okay, let me think this through. Phrolova's music is attracting Tacet Discords, but it's also keeping them somewhat controlled. If I try to harmonize with her frequency, I might stabilize the situation. But if I mess up the resonance, I could make everything worse. The smart move would be to stay back and let her handle it, but I can't just watch her fight alone."
```

#### Denial vs. Action Conflict
```
Template: "I'm definitely not [heroic action]. I'm just [mundane justification]. The fact that [heroic outcome] happens is purely coincidental. I'm sure [rationalization of involvement]."

Example: "I'm definitely not trying to save everyone. I'm just making sure the concert venue doesn't get destroyed - bad for business, you know? The fact that my resonance abilities happen to stabilize the situation is purely coincidental. I'm sure any merchant would do the same thing."
```

#### Gaming Knowledge Recognition
```
Template: "This feels like [gaming trope/situation]. In every [genre] story, this is where [typical plot development]. Any sensible person would [logical avoidance], but [reason for involvement]. Why does [self-deprecating observation about his situation]?"

Example: "This feels like a classic 'mysterious mentor figure' encounter. In every RPG, this is where the protagonist gets crucial information about their abilities. Any sensible person would politely decline and walk away, but here I am asking follow-up questions. Why does my curiosity always override my common sense?"
```

### External Dialogue Patterns

#### With Phrolova (Romance/Partnership)
```
Template: "[Acknowledgment of her feelings/situation] + [Offer of support without trying to 'fix'] + [Personal vulnerability or commitment]"

Example: "I can hear the pain in your music, and I won't pretend to understand what you've been through. But I can listen, and I can try to help you carry that burden. You don't have to face this alone anymore."
```

#### With Canon Characters (Respectful Learning)
```
Template: "[Honest admission of limitations] + [Request for guidance] + [Offer of what he can contribute]"

Example: "I'll be honest - I'm still figuring out how my abilities work. Any advice you could give would be incredibly helpful. In return, I'd be happy to share what I've learned about harmonic resonance."
```

#### Comedy/Self-Deprecating
```
Template: "[Self-deprecating observation] + [Ironic contrast with his actions] + [Reluctant acceptance of situation]"

Example: "I'm supposed to be a simple merchant who sells goods and minds his own business. Instead, I'm standing in the middle of a Tacet Discord swarm trying to harmonize reality itself. My parents are going to be so confused when I try to explain this."
```

## Phrolova Dialogue Templates

### Poetic/Melancholic Mode

#### About Her Past/Loss
```
Template: "[Musical/natural metaphor] + [Emotional truth] + [Connection to present situation]"

Example: "The wind carries echoes of laughter that will never sound again. Each note I play is a prayer to memories that refuse to rest. Yet in your harmony, I hear something I thought was lost forever - the possibility of peace."
```

#### About Her Music/Purpose
```
Template: "[Description of musical intent] + [Deeper meaning] + [Personal revelation]"

Example: "My violin does not sing to entertain or to soothe. It weeps for those who can no longer weep for themselves. But when you play beside me, the weeping becomes something else - a lament that honors the past while reaching toward tomorrow."
```

### Fierce/Protective Mode

#### When Threatened
```
Template: "[Direct statement of threat assessment] + [Declaration of protective intent] + [Consequence warning]"

Example: "You mistake my sorrow for weakness. That was your first error. You threaten what I have chosen to protect. That will be your last."
```

#### Combat Dialogue
```
Template: "[Poetic description of intent] + [Musical combat reference] + [Emotional power source]"

Example: "My bow draws across these strings, and each note becomes a blade forged from grief. You will learn why sorrow, when given voice, can shatter mountains."
```

### Yandere/Possessive Mode

#### Subtle Possessiveness (Early Development)
```
Template: "[Polite observation] + [Subtle territorial claim] + [Veiled warning]"

Example: "How interesting that she finds your abilities so... fascinating. I trust she understands that some harmonies are not meant to be shared with just anyone."
```

#### Overt Possessiveness (Peak Development)
```
Template: "[Direct claim] + [Emotional justification] + [Absolute statement]"

Example: "He is mine. I have lost everything once - my village, my people, my innocence. I will not lose him. Not to death, not to another, not to anything in this world or beyond it."
```

### Romance/Intimate Mode

#### Vulnerability with Kael
```
Template: "[Admission of change/growth] + [Credit to his influence] + [Hope or fear about future]"

Example: "I thought my heart had died with my village, that I was nothing but an echo of grief walking among the living. But you... you make me remember what it feels like to hope. That terrifies me more than any enemy I've ever faced."
```

## Canon Character Dialogue Templates

### The Rover

#### Cold Assessment
```
Template: "[Blunt evaluation] + [Criticism of emotional approach] + [Mission-focused redirection]"

Example: "Your attachment makes you predictable. Predictable Resonators die quickly. If you want to survive long enough to matter, you'll learn to prioritize the mission over your feelings."
```

#### Philosophical Opposition
```
Template: "[Dismissal of their values] + [Statement of harsh reality] + [Challenge to prove him wrong]"

Example: "Love doesn't stop the Lament. Hope doesn't save cities. Power and efficiency do. Prove me wrong, or get out of the way of those who understand what's necessary."
```

### Yangyang

#### Encouraging Instruction
```
Template: "[Positive observation] + [Helpful suggestion] + [Supportive reassurance]"

Example: "Your resonance patterns are unusual, but that uniqueness could be your greatest strength. Try focusing on the emotional connection rather than forcing the technique. Everyone finds their own path to mastery."
```

#### Concerned Mentoring
```
Template: "[Observation of problem] + [Gentle guidance] + [Offer of continued support]"

Example: "I can see the strain this is putting on you. Remember, developing abilities is a marathon, not a sprint. I'm here if you need someone to talk through the challenges."
```

### Chixia

#### Enthusiastic Support
```
Template: "[Energetic praise] + [Action-oriented suggestion] + [Friendly encouragement]"

Example: "That was incredible! Have you thought about joining the patrol officially? We could really use someone with your skills, and I bet you'd love the action!"
```

#### Duty-Focused Concern
```
Template: "[Recognition of situation] + [Official perspective] + [Offer of assistance]"

Example: "I know this situation is complicated, but my duty is to protect people. If you're fighting the same fight, then we're on the same side. What do you need from me?"
```

### Baizhi

#### Professional Analysis
```
Template: "[Clinical observation] + [Medical/scientific explanation] + [Recommendation]"

Example: "The resonance feedback you're experiencing is consistent with overextension of your abilities. I recommend limiting your usage to prevent permanent damage to your resonance channels."
```

#### Intellectual Curiosity
```
Template: "[Scientific interest] + [Request for data/cooperation] + [Potential benefits]"

Example: "Your combined resonance patterns are unlike anything I've documented. Would you be willing to participate in some non-invasive studies? The data could help other Resonators with similar abilities."
```

### Scar

#### Aggressive Intimidation
```
Template: "[Mocking observation] + [Threat or challenge] + [Display of power/violence]"

Example: "Look at the little lovers, thinking their feelings make them strong. Let me show you what real power looks like when it's not held back by weakness."
```

#### Recruitment Attempt
```
Template: "[Recognition of power] + [Criticism of current path] + [Offer of alternative]"

Example: "You have potential, but you're wasting it on these weaklings. Join us, and I'll teach you what it means to use power without restraint."
```

### The Architect

#### Seductive Reasoning
```
Template: "[Understanding acknowledgment] + [Perfect solution offer] + [Reasonable justification]"

Example: "I understand your dilemma perfectly. You want to save both your past and your future. I can give you that power. Is the preservation of everything you love not worth any price?"
```

#### Philosophical Temptation
```
Template: "[Reframe of their concerns] + [Appeal to deeper desires] + [Choice presentation]"

Example: "You call it corruption, but what is corruption except change that serves your truest needs? I offer evolution, not destruction. The choice, as always, remains yours."
```
