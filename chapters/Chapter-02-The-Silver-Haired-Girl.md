# Chapter 2: The Silver-Haired Girl

I was four when I met her.

The violin melody drifted through the evening air like something from a dream. I'd been helping Dad sort wool samples by texture when the music started, drawing me toward the village hall like a moth to flame.

"Go on," Mom said, noticing my distraction. "But be back before full dark."

I nodded and slipped out of our workshop, following the haunting melody through Ostina's winding streets. Other villagers had stopped their evening routines to listen. Mrs. Chen stood in her bakery doorway, flour still dusting her apron. Henrik had set down his hammer and emerged from his forge. Even Granny Leah had paused her evening walk to tilt her head toward the music.

But none of them seemed to see what I saw.

She sat on the steps of the village hall, silver hair catching the lamplight like spun moonbeams. Her white dress seemed to glow in the evening light, making her look almost ethereal. Her eyes were the color of violets, deep and mysterious in a way that seemed impossible for a child our age. Her violin was handmade—I could see the careful craftsmanship even from a distance—but she played it like magic.

That's when I saw it—the glow around her.

Not visible light, exactly. More like... importance. Like she was somehow more real than everything else, more significant. The air around her seemed to shimmer with potential, as if reality itself was paying attention to her in a way it didn't for anyone else.

The other children nearby—Tommy from the miller's family, Sarah whose parents ran the general store—looked flat by comparison. Like background characters in a story where she was clearly the star.

I blinked hard, rubbing my eyes. The glow remained.

"Tommy," I whispered to the boy standing next to me. "Do you see that?"

"See what?" he asked, not taking his eyes off the girl with the violin.

"The... the light around her."

Tommy gave me a strange look. "What light? She's just playing music, Caspian."

I tried again with Sarah. "Doesn't she look different to you? Special somehow?"

Sarah shrugged. "She's pretty, I guess. And she plays really well. But different how?"

They couldn't see it. Whatever I was seeing—this aura of significance that surrounded the silver-haired girl—it was invisible to everyone else.

My past-life knowledge kicked in. Main character. Had to be. The musical talent, the otherworldly beauty, the natural charisma, and now this mysterious quality that only I could perceive—all classic protagonist markers.

But why could I see it when others couldn't?

"Do you like music?" she asked, looking up with curious violet eyes. Her gaze found mine in the small crowd, as if she'd sensed my attention.

"You play beautifully," I managed, stepping closer.

She smiled like the sun coming out from behind clouds, and the glow around her pulsed brighter for just a moment. "I'm Phrolova. I don't think we've met."

"Caspian. My family runs the wool processing business on Merchant's Row."

"Oh! My father sells wool to your family sometimes. He says your father gives the fairest prices in the valley." She patted the step beside her, though something flickered across her expression—a shadow of sadness quickly hidden. "Do you play any instruments?"

"Piano," I said without thinking, then paused. Did I play piano? I had vague memories of lessons from my previous life, nothing serious, but...

"Really? There's an old piano in the hall. It's not in great condition, but it still works. Want to try playing together?"

That's how I discovered that remembering my past life meant I could still play piano.

The piano was indeed old, probably salvaged from some larger settlement and hauled here by optimistic villagers who thought culture was worth the transport costs. Half the keys stuck, and it was perpetually out of tune, but when I sat down and let my fingers find the keys, muscle memory took over.

I started with Canon in D—the familiar progression flowing from my fingers as if I'd played it yesterday. But as Phrolova joined in with her violin, something magical happened.

The glow around her intensified, spreading outward to encompass both of us. Her violin soared over my piano accompaniment, and together we created something that made the air itself seem to sing. The music became more than the sum of its parts, harmonies appearing that neither of us had planned.

"That was amazing!" she said when we finished, her eyes bright with excitement. "I've never played with anyone before. It felt like... like the music was alive."

I nodded, still processing what had just happened. The glow around her had intensified during the performance, and I'd felt something responding in myself—not the same brightness, but a complementary resonance, like we were two parts of the same instrument.

"Did you feel that?" I asked carefully. "When we played together?"

She tilted her head, considering. "Feel what?"

"Like... like something was connecting us through the music."

"Oh, that." She smiled as if it was the most natural thing in the world. "Music has always felt special to me. Like it connects to something bigger than just sound."

Right. Not actual supernatural perception, just a musically gifted child with an active imagination and natural talent.

"You don't think it's strange?" I pressed.

"Strange?" Phrolova laughed, a sound like silver bells. "Caspian, we live in a world where reality can fold in on itself without warning and monsters made of pure chaos roam the countryside. Feeling connected to music seems pretty normal by comparison."

She had a point. But her casual acceptance of what I was interpreting as supernatural abilities only confirmed what I already suspected—she was important to whatever story this world was telling.

And I was the only one who could see it.

Over the following days, I tested my perception carefully. I watched other villagers, looking for any sign of the glow I saw around Phrolova. Mrs. Chen had a faint warmth when she was baking, but nothing like Phrolova's radiance. Henrik showed brief flickers when he was working on a particularly challenging piece, but they faded quickly.

Only Phrolova blazed with that constant, steady light of significance.

I tried asking other adults about it, in roundabout ways.

"Mom, do some people seem more... important than others?"

"Well, of course, dear. The village elders, the merchants who bring us trade, people with special skills—"

"No, I mean... do they look different to you?"

Mom paused in her spinning. "Different how?"

"Never mind."

I tried Dad next. "Have you ever met someone who just seemed... special? Like they were meant for great things?"

Dad chuckled. "Your mother, for one. The day I met her, I knew she was going to change my life." He ruffled my hair. "And you, little man. Every parent thinks their child is destined for greatness."

"But did they look different? Like, actually look different?"

"Son, are you feeling alright? You've been asking strange questions lately."

I dropped the subject. Whatever I was seeing, it was mine alone to perceive.

Main character, I thought as I watched Phrolova practice her violin in the village square. She had to be the protagonist of whatever story this world was telling.

But wait... if she was the main character, what did that make me?

Am I glowing too? I wondered, and that evening I spent a long time staring at myself in our small mirror. No shimmer, no aura of importance—just a four-year-old boy with ordinary brown hair and curious eyes.

Maybe I was wrong about Phrolova. Maybe I should wait until I saw other people with that same glow before making any judgments about who was truly important in this world's story.

But sitting there in that dusty village hall, listening to Phrolova hum the melody we'd created together, I found I didn't mind the idea. There were worse fates than being the person who got to make music with someone like her.

What I didn't realize was that I wasn't the supporting character in her story.

I wasn't the protagonist either.

I was something else entirely—an anomaly in a world that already had its heroes and villains chosen. And my ability to see what others couldn't was just the first sign that I didn't quite fit into the story this world was trying to tell.

"Will you be around tomorrow?" she asked as we packed up the instruments.

"Every day. I live here, remember?"

"Good." She smiled again, and I felt that strange resonance in my chest. "I think we could make beautiful music together."

I couldn't help but smile back. At four years old, that sounded like the best possible future.

But as I walked home through Ostina's quiet streets, I couldn't shake the feeling that my eyes were showing me something important. Something that would matter more than I could possibly imagine.

I just didn't know what it meant yet.
