# Chapter 1: Echoes of Another Life

I died at twenty-eight.

Truck. Crosswalk. The usual story.

What I remember isn't the pain—that was quick. It's the hospital ceiling. Fluorescent lights buzzing like angry wasps while I thought, *Twenty-eight years of spreadsheets and this is how it ends.*

Then I was born again.

Not that I remember being born. Infantile amnesia took care of that, same as any normal kid. For the first few years, I was just... a baby. Crying, sleeping, learning to walk and talk like any other child.

But around age four, the memories started bleeding through.

Fragments at first. Dreams that felt too real. Knowledge I shouldn't have. Words in a language that didn't exist here.

By six, I knew the truth.

I was Caspian Thorne, merchant's son, born in this world.

But I was also someone else. Someone who'd lived twenty-eight years in a place with cars and computers and coffee shops.

See, when you get reincarnated into a fantasy world, you might think you'll dominate with your modern knowledge.

But once you actually get there, you come to a single realization.

I don't know jack shit.

Seriously. What was I going to do? Invent electricity? I couldn't even change a car tire without YouTube tutorials. Build a steam engine? I barely knew steam came from boiling water. Revolutionize agriculture? My houseplants died because I forgot to water them.

Most people didn't even know how their everyday devices worked. You flip a switch and lights come on—magic. You turn a tap and water flows—more magic. You're hungry, you order takeout—the greatest magic of all.

All those things we took for granted were things a normal person couldn't reproduce.

Sure, maybe someone with actual technical knowledge could manage something.

But sadly, I was a data entry clerk whose greatest achievement was memorizing keyboard shortcuts.

That's who I was.

And now I'm bouncing in the back of a merchant wagon, trying not to throw up from motion sickness while my six-year-old body processes memories that don't belong to it.

"Caspian, what's that song?"

Shit. I'd been humming again.

Chopin's Minute Waltz from a coffee shop in my old life. Back when coffee shops existed and I wasn't stuck in a six-year-old body that couldn't even reach the wagon's edge without help.

"I don't know," I said.

Mom—Mira Thorne—smiled and turned back to the road. Brown hair in a simple braid. Clothes worn from travel. Hands rough from grain sacks.

Everything about her screamed *background character.*

That's how I'd always seen people. Some looked normal—forgettable faces, practical clothes, the kind of people who belonged in crowds. Others stood out like they were painted in higher definition.

*Stop thinking like that,* I told myself. *These are real people.*

But I couldn't help it. My eyes sorted people automatically.

NPCs and main characters.

And I knew which category meant trouble.

Dad guided our horse around a pothole. "Boy's got music in him. Maybe we should get him an instrument when we reach town."

Garrett Thorne looked like every other merchant on the road. Simple clothes, weathered hands, hair cut with a knife when it got too long. 

Background character material.

Except for his eyes. Sometimes they held depths that didn't match his ordinary face.

*An instrument.*

My heart jumped. In my old life, I'd always planned to learn piano. Someday. When I had time. When I wasn't dead tired from work.

I'd died still planning.

Typical.

"We'll see what Verdant Hollow has," Mom said, ruffling my hair. "Though you're still so young."

I nodded and went back to watching the countryside. Green hills, clean air, no smog or traffic.

Should've been peaceful.

Wasn't.

Something made my skin crawl. Like static electricity before a storm.

"Frequency's getting stronger," Dad muttered, urging the horse faster.

I didn't need to ask what that meant. Even at six, I'd heard enough merchant talk.

Frequency disturbance meant Tacet Discords.

Tacet Discords meant death.

*This world is trying to kill everyone, all the time,* I realized. *And people just... live with it.*

Like it's normal! Like waking up and thinking "Oh, I hope reality doesn't collapse today" is a reasonable morning routine!

Because what choice did they have? Complain to customer service?

Frequency disturbance. Tacet Discords. Resonators. The Lament.

Something about those terms felt familiar. Like echoes from my old life.

That's when it hit me.

My gamer brain recognized the pattern. This world—with its specific terminology, its dangerous physics, its larger-than-life characters—felt like something that could've been inspired by a game from my old world.

Or maybe it was the other way around. Maybe some game developer had somehow glimpsed this reality and turned it into entertainment.

Either way, the realization was chilling.

This wasn't just a dangerous world.

It was a world *designed* to be dangerous. Where the story demanded conflict and crisis and heroes willing to die for the greater good.

*Well, the story can find someone else.*

Most people would be excited, right? Reborn in a fantasy world with magic and adventure and the chance to become legendary.

Me? I felt cold dread.

*This world will kill me.*

The thought was crystal clear. In my old life, the worst thing that could happen was getting fired. Maybe a bad performance review. Here? Monsters could tear me apart. Reality could collapse. Even the *air* was trying to murder people with "frequency disturbances."

*Fighting monsters to get stronger?*

That's the dumbest logic I've ever heard. It's like saying "I'll become a better driver by crashing into more cars." You know what makes you stronger? Not dying. Revolutionary concept, I know.

No. The smart play was obvious.

Stay with my parents. Learn the merchant trade. Travel safe routes between established towns. Keep my head down, avoid trouble, and live a long, boring life selling grain.

*Protagonists die,* I realized. *Background characters survive.*

It's basic narrative economics. Heroes get glory and death. Shopkeepers get steady income and retirement plans. Guess which one sounds better when you've already died once?

In my old world, I'd dreamed of adventure because it was safe to dream. Here, adventure meant death with extra steps.

The smart money was on being so forgettable that even Death would skip over me by accident.

*Is that cowardly?*

Absolutely.

*Do I care?*

Not even a little.

I'd rather be a living coward than a dead hero. Heroes get statues. Cowards get to see their grandchildren. Easy choice.

"Look there," Dad said. "Verdant Hollow."

The town spread below us. Thatched roofs, stone chimneys, high walls with watchtowers.

Pretty, but fortified.

This world's peace came at sword-point.

As we approached the gates, I studied the people moving about. Brown hair, black hair, the occasional blonde. Normal people living normal lives.

*NPCs,* my mind labeled them automatically.

*Background characters.*

Then I saw her.

A girl about my age with hair like spun silver. It caught the light even in shadow as she played by a fountain, chasing soap bubbles her mother was blowing.

*Main character quality,* I thought, watching her.

*Phrolova.*

My childhood friend and neighbor from Ostina. I'd always seen her differently. Everything about her seemed more... vivid. Her dress was perfectly fitted with intricate embroidery that probably cost more than most people's houses. Her hair fell in precise waves that defied physics and humidity. Even the way she moved had an almost choreographed grace, like she was perpetually ready for her close-up.

Because of that, I'd always kept my distance.

*Trouble for my ordinary dream.*

I wondered what kind of chaos she'd bring later. Ancient prophecies? Mysterious powers? A tragic backstory involving lost kingdoms? For now, she was just a kid chasing bubbles.

But those bubbles were probably magical. Everything was magical around people like her.

Still dangerous, though. People like her always were. They attracted plot like magnets attracted metal.

"Phrolova!" Mom called out, waving. "Elena!"

The silver-haired girl looked up, violet eyes lighting up. "Aunt Mira! Uncle Garrett!"

She ran over, her mother following. Elena had the same silver hair, though streaked with early gray, and the same striking presence. Well-made clothes, elegant posture.

Another person who existed in higher definition than everyone else.

*Great. Two main characters.*

"Caspian, you remember Phrolova, don't you?" Mom said. "You two used to play together back in Ostina."

Back home. Where we'd both been born before my parents took to the merchant roads.

"Hi, Caspian," Phrolova said shyly, then brightened. "Do you still hum those strange songs?"

*Strange songs.* Right. Melodies from a world that didn't exist here.

"Sometimes," I said.

*Keep it simple. Don't get involved.*

The adults talked. Trade routes. Frequency disturbances near Ostina. I listened with growing unease.

My parents looked worried. Elena went pale when they mentioned the disturbances.

"We'll be back through in a few months," Dad was saying. "The northern routes are safer right now."

"Be careful out there," Elena replied, hugging Phrolova closer. "Things have been... strange lately."

*Strange.* In this world, that usually meant deadly.

Our wagon rolled through the gates. The streets were busy but not chaotic. Merchants hawking wares, children playing, normal small-town rhythm.

*This is survival,* I thought. *This is how you stay alive.*

Boring. Predictable. Safe.

A simple life. A quiet life. Learning the merchant trade, maybe picking up piano along the way. Seeing the world from the safety of established trade routes.

No grand adventures—those got you killed.

No world-saving quests—those got you killed faster.

No dramatic confrontations with ancient evils—those were basically suicide.

Just ordinary. Safe. Alive.

In a world where monsters roamed free and reality could collapse without warning, being boring was the ultimate survival strategy.

*Let someone else be the hero.*

Don't get me wrong—I knew protagonists existed in this world. Had to. Worlds like this didn't run on merchant logic; they ran on hero logic. Someone out there was destined to save everyone, defeat the ancient evils, and restore balance to the universe.

But I wasn't stupid enough to think that someone was me.

I was a reincarnated data entry clerk with motion sickness and a fear of commitment. The universe had standards.

"We'll stable the horse and find an inn," Dad said, pulling up beside a weathered building. The sign showed a prancing pony. "Tomorrow we can look into that instrument."

As we climbed down, I started humming again. Different melody this time. Foreign but familiar.

Dad's expression changed. "Interesting tune, son. Almost sounds like..."

His hand moved to his throat, touching something hidden under his shirt. For a moment, his eyes held depths that didn't match his merchant facade.

*He knows something.*

About me? About the songs?

But he just smiled and ruffled my hair. "Come on, let's get settled in."

*Great. Even my background character parents have secrets.*

This world really didn't want anyone to stay ordinary. It was like the universe had a personal vendetta against boring, safe lives. 

*"Oh, you want to sell grain peacefully? Here's a mysterious bloodline! You want to avoid adventure? Your childhood friend is probably a chosen one! You want to stay anonymous? Your parents are definitely hiding ancient artifacts!"*

I could practically hear the cosmic laughter.

The inn was warm and welcoming. The innkeeper—brown hair, forgettable face, definitely an NPC—showed us to a room with two beds and a window overlooking the town square.

"Dinner's in an hour," she said. "Fresh bread and mutton stew."

After she left, I sat by the window and watched people below. Most were ordinary folk going about evening routines. Simple clothes, practical hairstyles, comfortable anonymity.

But occasionally, someone stood out. A man with an elaborate coat too clean for travel. A woman with complex braids that must've taken hours. People who looked like they belonged in paintings instead of dusty streets.

*The way I've always seen certain people.*

More detailed. More authentic.

It had been like this since I was small. Some people just looked different to my eyes.

*I want to be ordinary. Forgettable.*

But looking down at my simple traveling clothes, I had a sinking feeling.

*What if I'm not?*

What if I was one of those "hidden genius" types? What if my humming strange songs was actually some kind of ancient magic? What if my ability to see "main characters" was itself a main character trait?

*Oh no.*

What if I was the protagonist?

That would be the worst possible outcome. Protagonists had the highest mortality rate in dangerous worlds. They were basically walking target practice for every villain, monster, and cosmic horror in existence.

"Caspian," Mom called. "Come away from the window. Time to wash up for dinner."

I obeyed, but not before one last look at the town square. Somewhere out there, Phrolova was probably having dinner with her mother.

*I wonder if I'll see her again.*

Probably not for a while. The merchant routes kept us moving.

It was strange, seeing her after so long. She seemed happy enough, safe with her mother.

That was good.

Everyone deserved to be safe.

Tomorrow, we'd look for a piano. Maybe a small one I could practice on during travels. I'd learn to play properly this time, not just dream about it.

Such a simple, reasonable goal.

For now, I was just a six-year-old boy with impossible memories and modest dreams, getting ready for dinner in a small town inn.

*Stay ordinary. Stay safe. Stay alive.*

Three simple rules. A perfectly reasonable life philosophy.

It seemed simple enough.

But this was a world that felt like it belonged in some epic game where "simple" was a four-letter word and "safe" was a myth told to children.

Nothing stayed simple for long.

Especially not when you were trying really, really hard to avoid being interesting.

The universe had a sense of irony like that.
