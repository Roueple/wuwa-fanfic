# Chapter 1: Second Chances

**Three years earlier...**

Sword and magic isekai was every man's dream, right? Becoming the hero, defeating evil, maybe even marrying a princess—all the classic fantasies that made boring Earth life seem so mundane in comparison.

When I first learned I'd been reincarnated into a world called Solaris-3, I was ecstatic. No more office cubicles, no more quarterly reports, no more existential dread about making widgets for companies that made slightly different widgets. This was my chance to be someone important, someone who mattered.

"Here I come! Caspian the protagonist! HAHAHAHAHA!"

That's what I'd thought when my memories first returned at age three.

My first clear memory wasn't of this world, though.

It was the taste of coffee—bitter, black, and completely wrong for a three-year-old's mouth. I'd been reaching for what I thought was my morning cup when tiny hands reminded me that I wasn't twenty-eight anymore.

"Caspian!" Mom's voice carried that mix of amusement and exasperation I'd somehow forgotten existed. "What are you doing, little one?"

Little one. Right. That's what I was now.

Elena Thorne—my mother in this life—had the kind of warm brown eyes that crinkled at the corners when she smiled, which was often. At twenty-seven, she still had that youthful energy that came with being young enough to chase after a toddler all day, but old enough to handle it with practiced grace. Her auburn hair was always pulled back in a practical bun, and her hands bore the calluses of someone who worked with wool and fabric daily. She had infinite patience for a curious three-year-old, even one who occasionally tried to drink coffee.

"Sorry, Mom," I mumbled, setting down the mug with my small, clumsy fingers.

"Marcus!" she called toward the back of our house. "Your son is trying to grow up too fast again!"

Dad's laughter echoed from the workshop where he processed raw wool into the fine threads that made our family's living. Marcus Thorne was a big man with gentle hands, the kind who could handle delicate fibers with the same care he showed when ruffling my hair. At twenty-nine, he had the solid confidence of someone who'd found his place in the world early and was content with it. His beard was perpetually dusted with wool particles, and he smelled like lanolin and hard work.

"Takes after his old man," Dad called back. "Always reaching for things beyond his grasp!"

*Old man?* I thought with amusement. *My mental age is older than you, Dad.* The irony wasn't lost on me—here I was, a former twenty-eight-year-old being called precocious by someone barely a year older than my previous self had been.

The memories came back in pieces over the following months—fragments of office politics, traffic jams, and the particular brand of existential dread that came with eight-hour meetings about quarterly projections. All of it felt distant, like remembering a vivid dream.

But the knowledge stuck. I understood that this wasn't Earth—that much was obvious from the strange architecture and the way people dressed.

"Mom, what are those shimmery things in the air?" I asked one afternoon, pointing at the distortions that made my eyes water.

"Those?" She followed my gaze. "Oh, those are just aftereffects from the old Lament. Nothing to worry about, dear. They'll fade in time."

*Lament?* That sounded ominous.

"What's a Lament?"

Mom's expression grew careful. "Something that happened before you were born. The grown-ups handled it."

I tried Dad next. "Why do we have walls around the village?"

"To keep the bad things out," he said simply, not looking up from his work.

"What bad things?"

"Tacet Discords. Monsters that wander in from the wild sometimes."

*Monsters.* Right. Because of course there were monsters.

This wasn't Earth. This was somewhere far more dangerous. And unlike the heroes in the stories I'd read, I had no special knowledge about this world—I was flying completely blind.

Our home sat on Merchant's Row in Ostina, a village of maybe two hundred souls nestled in a valley that felt forgotten by the larger world. Which, given what I was learning about this reality, was probably a blessing. Forgotten places tended to be safer places.

Ostina was the kind of settlement where everyone knew everyone else's business. Mrs. Chen ran the bakery and somehow always knew who was courting whom before the couples themselves figured it out. Old Henrik the blacksmith could tell you the weather three days in advance by the way his joints ached.

And then there was Granny Leah.

"Caspian Thorne!" she called one morning as I wandered past her house. "Come here, child."

I approached cautiously. Granny Leah wasn't actually anyone's grandmother, but she'd claimed the title through sheer force of personality.

"Yes, ma'am?"

She studied me with sharp eyes, then smiled and pressed a honey cake into my hands. "There's a good boy. But remember—" Her expression grew stern. "A child who doesn't learn respect grows into an adult who doesn't deserve it."

"Yes, ma'am," I repeated, though I wasn't entirely sure what I was agreeing to.

She ruffled my hair. "Smart lad. Now run along before your mother wonders where you've gotten to."

Even at three, I could tell she was someone important—not in terms of official authority, but in the way that really mattered in small communities.

The village was built around the wool trade. Sheep grazed in the surrounding hills, their fleeces providing the raw material that kept our little economy running. Merchant caravans would stop by every few weeks to buy processed wool, bringing news from the outside world and goods we couldn't make ourselves.

It was a simple life. A safe life. The kind of place where the biggest excitement was usually the seasonal festivals and the occasional argument over whose sheep had wandered into whose pasture.

I learned just how dangerous the outside world was when I found one of Dad's old books in our storage room.

"Dad, what's this?" I asked, dragging the heavy tome to where he worked.

He glanced at the cover and frowned. "Where did you find that?"

"Storage room. It says 'A History of Calamities.'"

Dad set down his tools and lifted me onto his lap, opening the book carefully. "This belonged to my father. He was... interested in such things."

The numbers inside were insane. In the past 500 years alone, there had been over 10,000 regional Laments—reality-warping disasters that could reshape entire landscapes overnight. And five global Laments that had nearly ended civilization itself.

"Are these real?" I asked, pointing at an illustration of a city being swallowed by darkness.

"Very real," Dad said quietly. "This world is dangerous, son. That's why we stay in places like Ostina."

"Dad," I asked one evening as he worked at his spinning wheel, "why do we have walls around the village?"

He paused in his work, glancing at Mom before answering. "Well, little man, the world outside can be dangerous. Tacet Discords sometimes wander through, and the walls help keep them out."

*Little man.* There it was again. I had to resist the urge to roll my eyes. If only he knew that his "little man" had once sat through board meetings that would make grown adults weep.

"What are Tacet Discords?"

Another pause. "Monsters, son. Born from chaos itself. They're drawn to sound and movement, but they can't think like people can. The walls and the watch towers help keep us safe."

"Have you ever seen one?"

Dad's expression grew distant. "Once, when I was about your age. A small one wandered into the village square during market day. The guards handled it quickly, but..." He shook his head. "They're not natural things, Caspian. Best to stay away from them."

This world was completely, utterly insane. The kind of place where town-ending catastrophes could happen at any moment, where monsters spawned from chaos itself roamed the countryside, where reality could fold in on itself without warning.

And somehow, I'd been reincarnated into it.

But as I watched my parents work together—Mom sorting wool by quality while Dad spun it into thread—I felt something I hadn't expected. Hope.

In my previous life, I'd been nobody special. A middle manager in a company that made widgets for other companies that made slightly different widgets. I'd lived alone, eaten microwave dinners, and spent my weekends binge-watching shows about people who actually did interesting things with their lives.

Here, I had parents who loved me. A community that cared about each other. And if this world operated on story logic like I suspected, then maybe—just maybe—I could be someone important this time.

The thought should have been terrifying. Instead, it was oddly comforting. At least this time, I'd know what I was doing. I'd read enough fantasy novels to recognize the patterns, and I had the wisdom of a previous life to guide me. What could possibly go wrong?

Sure, I didn't have any special knowledge about this world's history or hidden secrets. But the basic rules of fantasy worlds had to be similar, didn't they?

Magic world, check. Monsters, check. Mysterious powers, check. 

Which meant I was probably the protagonist.

I started paying attention to everything with new eyes. The way the morning light hit the mountains surrounding our valley. The patterns in the wool that Dad processed. The stories the merchants told about distant cities and strange phenomena.

And I started dreaming about the future. Not the mundane future of taking over the family business—though that was a perfectly respectable path—but something grander. Adventures beyond the valley. Mysteries to solve. Powers to discover.

Maybe I'd become a great warrior, defending villages from Tacet Discord attacks. Or a scholar, unraveling the secrets of the Laments. Or perhaps a merchant-adventurer, traveling the world and seeing wonders beyond imagination.

The possibilities felt endless.

I was three years old, and I was going to be the hero of my own story. I'd explore ancient ruins, battle monsters, uncover lost secrets, and maybe even save the world. The family business could wait—there were adventures calling my name.

This was going to be amazing.

I just had to figure out how to start.
