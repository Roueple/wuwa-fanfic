# Chapter 2: The Music of Memory

Ten years later, and I still couldn't get used to waking up without an alarm clock.

No buzzing phone. No snooze button. Just sunlight creeping through wagon canvas and the steady clip-clop of hooves on dirt roads.

At sixteen, I'd grown into my merchant family role pretty well. Tall enough to help load cargo, old enough to handle negotiations, smart enough to spot a bad deal from three towns away.

The perfect background character life.

Except for one problem.

I was bored out of my mind.

"Caspian, you're humming again," Mom said from the driver's bench.

"Sorry." I stopped mid-melody—something from a movie soundtrack I'd loved in my previous life. The tune had been stuck in my head for days.

"Don't apologize," Dad said, guiding our horse around a muddy patch. "Just curious where you pick up these melodies. They're not from any bard I know."

*Because they're from a world that doesn't exist here.*

"I make them up," I said. Half-true. I wasn't composing them, but I was the only one bringing them into this world.

"Talented boy," Mom smiled. "Maybe we should finally get you that instrument we've been promising."

My heart jumped. For ten years, they'd been saying "maybe next town" or "when we have the coin" or "when we find the right one." I'd started to think it was just something parents said to keep kids happy.

"Really?"

"Verdant Hollow has a music shop," Dad said. "Old Henrik imports instruments from all over. Might have something suitable."

Verdant Hollow. We came through here every few months on our regular routes. It was one of our reliable stops between home and the northern territories.

I'd seen Phrolova here plenty of times over the years. Brief encounters—a wave across the market square, polite conversation when our families crossed paths at the inn. She lived here with her mother while we were based out of Ostina.

*She'll probably be at the fountain again,* I thought. *She always is when we pass through.*

Main characters had their patterns, and hers seemed to involve that fountain.

Our wagon rolled through familiar gates. The town had grown since our last visit. New buildings, busier streets, more guards on the walls.

Progress, but with the usual edge of caution this world demanded.

The music shop sat between a bakery and a blacksmith, its windows displaying violins, flutes, and something that looked like a cross between a harp and a torture device.

"Henrik's still here," Dad noted. "Good. He knows quality."

Inside, the shop was cramped but organized. Instruments hung from every surface—some familiar, others completely alien. The air smelled of wood polish and old leather.

"Garrett Thorne!" A voice boomed from the back. "Haven't seen you in years!"

Henrik emerged from behind a curtain. Tall, thin, with wild gray hair and fingers stained from wood dye. The kind of craftsman who lived for his work.

"Henrik," Dad clasped his hand. "Good to see you thriving. This is my son, Caspian. He's interested in learning an instrument."

Henrik's eyes lit up. "Ah! The boy who hums strange melodies! I remember you from our last visit."

Of course he'd remember. I'd been humming outside his shop while my parents negotiated grain prices.

"What calls to you, young man?" Henrik gestured at his collection. "Violin for passion? Flute for travel? Lute for romance?"

I looked around, but my eyes kept returning to the corner where a small upright piano sat covered in dust.

"That one," I said.

Henrik followed my gaze and frowned. "The piano? Interesting choice. Most young people prefer portable instruments."

"Can I try it?"

"Of course, of course!" He bustled over and pulled off the dust cover. "This beauty came from Jinzhou. Crafted by masters, though I'll admit it's been sitting here for months. Not many buyers for something so... substantial."

The piano was beautiful. Dark wood with ivory keys that had yellowed slightly with age. It looked exactly like the upright my neighbor had owned in my previous life—the one I'd always wanted to learn on but never had the courage to ask.

I sat on the bench and placed my fingers on the keys.

*Here goes nothing.*

I started with something simple. A melody I'd hummed a thousand times but never heard played properly.

The notes filled the shop, clear and resonant. My fingers found the keys like they'd been waiting sixteen years for this moment.

*Muscle memory from a life I never lived.*

But that was impossible. I'd never learned piano in either life.

So why did this feel so natural?

The melody flowed into something more complex. Harmonies I shouldn't know. Chord progressions that made perfect sense even though I'd never studied music theory.

Behind me, I heard Mom gasp.

I kept playing, lost in the music. This wasn't just entertainment—it was expression. All the frustration of living in a world that wanted to kill me, all the loneliness of carrying memories that didn't belong, all the fear of being more than I wanted to be.

It poured out through my fingers.

When I finally stopped, the shop was silent.

"Where did you learn that?" Henrik whispered.

"I... didn't." I stared at my hands. "I've never played piano before."

"Impossible." He moved closer. "That was advanced technique. Years of training."

*Unless you count twenty-eight years of wanting to learn and never doing it.*

Maybe that was it. Maybe all those years of dreaming about piano in my previous life had somehow translated into ability here. Reincarnation benefits I hadn't expected.

Or maybe it was something else entirely. Some quirk of reincarnation I'd never expected.

"How much?" Dad asked quietly.

"For that performance? Nothing." Henrik shook his head. "That piano has been waiting for the right player. I can see it belongs with him."

"Henrik, we can't—"

"You can and you will." The old man's eyes were bright. "Music like that shouldn't be caged. Besides," he grinned, "I have a feeling this boy will make that piano famous someday."

Famous. The word sent a thrill through me I hadn't expected. Maybe I could be known for something beautiful instead of just... existing.

"I'd like that," I said, surprising myself. "Maybe I could play in taverns during our stops. Earn some extra coin."

"Now there's an idea," Henrik nodded approvingly.

We arranged to have the piano loaded onto our wagon. It would make traveling harder, but Dad seemed determined to make it work.

"We'll need a bigger wagon," he muttered, calculating space. "And stronger horses."

"Are you sure about this?" I asked. "It's a lot of trouble for a hobby."

Dad looked at me seriously. "Son, I've heard you humming for ten years. Those melodies... they're something special. If you have a gift, we should nurture it."

A gift. Maybe that wasn't such a bad thing. Music was harmless enough—beautiful, even. And if I could make people happy while earning coin, why not?

As we left the shop, I caught sight of a familiar figure across the square.

Silver hair catching sunlight. Violet eyes that seemed to hold depths no sixteen-year-old should possess. She was taller now, more graceful, but unmistakably the same girl from years ago.

*Phrolova.*

She was talking to a group of other teenagers, but something about her posture suggested she wasn't really part of their conversation. Like she was there but separate.

Our eyes met across the square.

She smiled and waved.

I waved back, then found myself walking over.

"Caspian!" she said, brightening. "I heard music from Henrik's shop. Was that you?"

"Yeah, just trying out a piano." I felt oddly proud. "We're taking it home."

"That's wonderful. You always had such interesting melodies." She paused. "Maybe you could play something for me sometime? When you pass through again?"

"I'd like that," I said, and meant it.

"Ready to go?" Dad asked.

"Yeah." I climbed into the wagon, settling next to my new piano. "Where to next?"

"Back to Ostina," Mom said. "We have buyers waiting for the grain we picked up in Dim Forest, and it'll be good to sleep in our own beds for a few weeks."

Home. Our actual house, where we returned between trading circuits. Where I had my own room and Mom had her garden and Dad kept his ledgers.

*Just the normal rhythm of merchant life,* I told myself. *Nothing unusual about going home.*

But as our wagon rolled out of Verdant Hollow, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was shifting. Like pieces on a board moving into position.

The piano sat beside me, silent but somehow expectant.

*Just an instrument,* I reminded myself. *Just a hobby.*

But my fingers itched to play again. To explore those melodies that came from nowhere and felt like everything.

Behind us, Verdant Hollow shrank into the distance.

Ahead, the familiar road home stretched toward Ostina.

And somewhere between the two, I felt like my life was finally gaining some direction.

The music in my head was getting louder, more complex.

And for the first time since my reincarnation, that didn't seem like a bad thing.
