# Prologue: "The Main Character Delusion" (Ages 3-6)

## Section 1: Memory Awakening (Age 3-4)

My first clear memory wasn't of this world.

It was the taste of coffee—bitter, black, and completely wrong for a three-year-old's mouth. I'd been reaching for what I thought was my morning cup when tiny hands reminded me that I wasn't twenty-eight anymore, wasn't sitting in a cramped office cubicle, and definitely wasn't late for another soul-crushing meeting about quarterly projections.

I was three years old, sitting in the dirt outside a merchant's wagon, and I'd just tried to drink from my father's travel mug.

"Caspian!" Mom's voice carried that particular mix of amusement and exasperation that I'd somehow forgotten existed. "What are you doing, little one?"

Little one. Right. That's what I was now.

The memories came back in pieces over the following months, like a jigsaw puzzle someone was assembling in my head while I slept. Fragments of a previous life—office politics, traffic jams, the particular brand of existential dread that came with realizing you'd spent eight hours of your day in meetings that could have been emails. All of it felt distant and strange, like remembering a particularly vivid dream.

But the knowledge stuck. I knew things a three-year-old shouldn't know. I understood that the strange, shimmering distortions in the air weren't normal weather patterns—they were aftereffects of something called a Lament. I recognized the way adults' voices dropped to whispers when they talked about Tacet Discords, and I understood why every settlement had walls and why merchants traveled in groups.

This wasn't Earth. This was somewhere else entirely, somewhere that felt suspiciously like the fantasy worlds I'd binged in light novels during my previous life's lunch breaks.

Which meant, according to every piece of genre fiction I'd ever consumed, that I was probably the protagonist.

The thought should have been terrifying. Instead, it was oddly comforting. At least this time around, I'd know what I was doing.

Our family had lived in Ostina for generations. Dad ran the local wool processing business, working with the farmers who raised sheep in the surrounding hills. Mom helped with the books and handled sales to the merchant caravans that passed through. They were good people, the kind who'd give you the shirt off their back if you needed it, which probably explained why we were comfortable but never wealthy.

Ostina village was our home—a small farming community nestled in a valley that felt like it had been forgotten by the larger world. Which, given what I was learning about this reality, was probably a good thing. Forgotten places tended to be safer places.

The village had maybe two hundred people, most of them farmers or crafters who supplied the merchant caravans that passed through. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, where children played in the streets without fear, and where the biggest excitement was usually the seasonal festivals.

It was also where I met her.

I was four when I first heard Phrolova play.

The sound drifted through the evening air like something from a dream—a violin melody that seemed to make the very air shimmer with possibility. I'd been helping Dad inventory wool samples when the music started, and I found myself drawn toward it like a moth to flame.

She was sitting on the steps of the village hall, a girl about my age with dark hair that caught the lamplight. Her violin was clearly handmade, probably by one of the village crafters, but the way she played it made it sound like something magical.

And that's when I saw it.

The glow.

It wasn't visible light, exactly. More like... importance. Like she was somehow more real than everything around her, more defined, more significant. The other children playing nearby looked flat by comparison, like background characters in a story where she was clearly the star.

My past-life knowledge kicked in with all the subtlety of a brick to the face. Main character. Definitely main character. The musical talent, the natural charisma, the way she seemed to draw attention without trying—all classic protagonist markers.

Of course, I was completely wrong about what kind of protagonist she was destined to become. But I wouldn't learn that for another ten years.

Which made me...

"Do you like music?" she asked, looking up at me with curious eyes.

"I... yes," I managed, suddenly aware that I was staring. "You play beautifully."

She smiled, and it was like watching the sun come out from behind clouds. "I'm Phrolova. I don't think we've met."

"Caspian," I said, offering a small bow that felt natural despite my young age. "My family runs the wool processing business. We live on Merchant's Row."

"Oh, you're the processor's son! My father sells wool to your family sometimes. He said your father gives the fairest prices in the valley." Phrolova set her violin aside and patted the step next to her. "Do you play any instruments?"

"Piano," I said without thinking, then paused. Did I play piano? I had vague memories of lessons from my previous life, nothing serious, but...

"Really? There's an old piano in the hall. It's not in great condition, but it still works. Would you like to try playing together?"

And that's how I discovered that whatever cosmic force had reincarnated me had been generous with the skill transfers.

The piano was indeed old, probably salvaged from some larger settlement and hauled here by optimistic villagers who thought culture was worth the transport costs. Half the keys stuck, and it was perpetually out of tune, but when I sat down and let my fingers find the keys, muscle memory took over.

I started with something simple—a melody I half-remembered from my previous life, probably from a movie soundtrack. But as Phrolova joined in with her violin, something magical happened. The music became more than the sum of its parts. Her violin soared over my piano accompaniment, and together we created something that made the air itself seem to sing.

"That was amazing!" she said when we finished, her eyes bright with excitement. "I've never played with anyone before. It felt like... like the music was alive."

I nodded, still processing what had just happened. The glow around her had intensified during the performance, and I'd felt something responding in myself—not quite the same brightness, but a complementary resonance, like we were two parts of the same instrument.

Supporting character, I thought. That's what I was supposed to be. The childhood friend, the musical partner, the one who helped the protagonist discover her true potential.

It should have been disappointing. In all those novels I'd read, the supporting characters usually got the short end of the stick—forgotten when the real plot kicked in, or worse, killed off to motivate the hero.

But sitting there in that dusty village hall, listening to Phrolova hum the melody we'd just created, I found I didn't mind the idea. There were worse fates than being the person who got to make music with someone like her.

What I didn't realize was that I wasn't the supporting character in her story. I was the protagonist of my own—and she was destined to become my greatest enemy.

"Will you be around tomorrow?" she asked as we packed up the instruments.

"Every day," I said. "I live here, remember?"

"Good." She smiled again, and I felt that strange resonance in my chest. "I'd like to play with you again. I think we could make beautiful music together."

Famous last words, I thought, but I smiled back anyway.

After all, what was the worst that could happen?

## Section 2: Musical Partnership Development (Age 4-5)

By age four, I'd figured out the basics.

This world operated on story logic, which meant certain rules applied. Main characters had special abilities that awakened during moments of crisis. Supporting characters existed to help them discover and develop those abilities. And if you paid attention to the patterns, you could usually predict what was coming next.

What I hadn't predicted was how addictive it would be to make music with Phrolova.

Every day after helping Dad with the wool processing, I found myself drawn to that old piano in the village hall. And every time, Phrolova would be there waiting, violin in hand, ready to create something new.

Our musical partnership evolved quickly. What started as simple melodies became complex harmonies, with her violin dancing around my piano accompaniment in ways that shouldn't have been possible for children our age. But then again, she wasn't exactly a normal child.

The glow around her was getting stronger.

It was subtle at first—just that sense of heightened reality I'd noticed when we first met. But as the months passed and our musical sessions became more frequent, it became impossible to ignore. When Phrolova played, the air itself seemed to respond. Dust motes would dance in patterns that followed her melody. Flowers in nearby gardens would turn toward the sound. Even the village cats would gather to listen, sitting in perfect circles around the hall.

"Do you notice anything... different when we play together?" I asked her one evening after a particularly intense session. We'd been working on a piece that seemed to write itself, with harmonies that appeared in my mind fully formed.

She tilted her head, considering. "Different how?"

"Like the music is doing more than just making sound."

"Oh, that." She smiled as if it was the most natural thing in the world. "Music has always felt special to me. Like it connects to something bigger than just sound."

Right. Not actual powers manifesting, just a musically gifted child with an active imagination and natural talent.

"You don't think it's strange?" I pressed.

"Strange?" Phrolova laughed, a sound like silver bells. "Caspian, we live in a world where reality can fold in on itself without warning and monsters made of pure chaos roam the countryside. Feeling connected to music seems pretty normal by comparison."

She had a point. But her casual acceptance of what I was interpreting as supernatural abilities only confirmed what I already suspected—she was important to whatever story this world was telling, even if her true power was still years away from awakening.

Which meant my role was to help her develop them.

I threw myself into the task with the enthusiasm of someone who finally understood their purpose. I researched music theory from the few books available in Ostina's small library. I practiced piano until my fingers ached. I experimented with different harmonies and chord progressions, looking for combinations that would bring out the best in Phrolova's increasingly supernatural performances.

And it worked. Our duets became local legends. People would travel from neighboring settlements just to hear us play. The village elders started scheduling our performances around important events, claiming our music brought good luck and prosperity.

"You two are quite the pair," Mrs. Chen, the village baker, told my mother one afternoon. "That boy of yours has a gift for bringing out the best in our Phrolova."

A gift for bringing out the best in the protagonist. Exactly what a good supporting character should do.

But I wasn't content to just be a musical accompanist. If this world operated on story logic, then there had to be more to my role than just playing piano. And if I was wrong about being a supporting character—if I was actually the protagonist of this story—then I needed to start acting like it.

So I started exploring.

Ostina was surrounded by rolling hills and small forests, perfect for a curious child with too much genre knowledge for his own good. I began taking solo walks during the days when we weren't scheduled for musical practice, venturing further from the village each time.

I told myself I was being smart about it. I carried a whistle to call for help. I stayed on established paths. I never went out alone after dark. But the truth was, I was looking for something—some sign that the larger story was beginning, some hint of the adventures that were surely waiting just beyond the horizon.

And I found them.

Not adventures, exactly, but signs. Tracks in the mud that were too large and strangely shaped to belong to any normal animal. Trees with bark that had been scored by claws the size of dinner plates. Areas where the grass grew in perfect spirals, as if reality had twisted itself into knots.

Tacet Discord signs. I was sure of it.

The smart thing would have been to report these findings to the village elders, let the adults handle the dangerous stuff. But protagonists didn't play it safe—they investigated mysteries and faced dangers head-on.

"You've been wandering far from the village," Phrolova observed one afternoon as I returned from a particularly long expedition. She was sitting on her usual spot on the hall steps, tuning her violin.

"Just exploring," I said, trying to sound casual. "There's a lot to see out there."

"Dangerous things to see, you mean." Her tone was mild, but there was something in her eyes that made me pause. "The adults talk, you know. They think children don't listen, but we do. There have been sightings."

"Sightings of what?"

"Tacet Discords. Small ones, mostly, but getting closer to the village." She set her violin aside and looked at me directly. "You're not thinking of going looking for them, are you?"

The question caught me off guard. Was I? The thought had certainly crossed my mind. In all the stories I'd read, the protagonist's powers usually awakened during their first real encounter with danger. And if Phrolova was the protagonist...

"Maybe," I admitted. "If we're going to live in a world with monsters, shouldn't we know what we're dealing with?"

"We're five years old, Caspian."

"So? Age is just a number. And you have abilities. I can feel them getting stronger every time we play."

She was quiet for a long moment, absently plucking at her violin strings. "You really think I'm special, don't you?"

"I know you are." The certainty in my voice surprised even me. "You're going to do amazing things, Phrolova. I can see it."

"And what about you?" she asked softly. "What amazing things are you going to do?"

The question hit harder than it should have. What was I going to do? In the stories I'd read, there were two possibilities: either I was the supporting character who helped her shine, or I was the protagonist of my own story and she was... something else.

"I guess we'll find out," I said finally.

She smiled at that, picking up her violin again. "Well, whatever we do, we'll do it together, right? Partners?"

"Partners," I agreed, settling down beside her as she began to play.

But even as I joined in with the piano melody that seemed to flow naturally from her violin's song, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something important. Some piece of the puzzle that would make everything else fall into place.

The answer, I was sure, was out there in those hills. In the places where reality bent and twisted, where monsters roamed and adventures waited.

I just had to be brave enough to find it.

By age five, I'd convinced myself I was ready for anything.

Famous last words, right there.## 

Section 3: Adventure Phase and Overconfidence (Age 5-6)

By age five, I'd figured out the pattern.

Every story needed a catalyst. Some moment of crisis that would awaken the protagonist's true power and set the real adventure in motion. And if I was the protagonist—which I was becoming more convinced of every day—then I needed to find that moment myself.

The problem was, Ostina was almost aggressively peaceful.

Oh, there were signs of danger if you knew where to look. The Tacet Discord tracks I'd been finding were getting fresher, closer to the village. The adults' conversations carried more worry than they used to. But nothing was actually happening. No dramatic encounters, no sudden attacks, no convenient crises to trigger Phrolova's awakening.

So I decided to go looking for one.

"You're spending a lot of time away from the village," Dad observed one morning as I prepared for another expedition. "Your mother's starting to worry."

"I'm just exploring," I said, checking my small pack for the third time. Water, dried fruit, the whistle Mom insisted I carry, and a small knife that was probably more dangerous to me than to any potential threats. "There's so much to see out here."

"Dangerous things to see," he said, echoing Phrolova's words from weeks earlier. "The merchant networks have been reporting increased Tacet Discord activity in the region. Maybe it's time to stick closer to home."

Increased activity. Perfect.

"I'll be careful," I promised, and I meant it. I wasn't stupid, despite what my actions might have suggested. I had a plan.

The plan was simple: find evidence of Tacet Discord presence, report it to the adults, and let them handle the actual dangerous part while Phrolova and I observed from a safe distance. When our powers inevitably awakened during the encounter—because that's how these things worked—we'd both emerge as heroes.

It was foolproof. What could go wrong?

I started ranging further from Ostina, following the strange tracks and reality distortions that marked Tacet Discord passage. My expeditions became more frequent and more daring. I learned to read the signs—the way grass grew in spirals around their resting spots, the metallic taste in the air that preceded their appearance, the subtle wrongness that made my skin crawl even when I couldn't see anything dangerous.

And I started listening. Really listening.

The adults thought children didn't pay attention to their conversations, but they were wrong. I heard every whispered report from traveling merchants, every worried discussion between the village elders, every casual mention of sightings and encounters.

"Three of them spotted near the old mill ruins," I overheard Mrs. Chen telling the blacksmith. "Small ones, but still dangerous."

The old mill ruins. I knew that place—a half-day's walk from the village, where an ambitious settler had tried to build a grain mill before the last regional Lament had twisted the local geography into something unusable. It was exactly the kind of place where a young protagonist might have her first encounter with the supernatural.

"We should organize a patrol," the blacksmith replied. "Can't have them getting any closer to the village."

A patrol. Even better. If I could time things right, I could get to the ruins just as the adults arrived to deal with the threat. My powers would awaken, I'd help save the day, and everyone would recognize me as the hero I was meant to be.

It was perfect.

But I wasn't stupid enough to bring Phrolova into danger. Whatever protagonist awakening I was planning, it would have to be a solo adventure.

"I'm going to visit my cousin in the next valley over," I told my parents the morning of the planned expedition. It was a lie, but a believable one—we did have relatives there, and I'd visited before.

"Be careful on the road," Mom said, packing me a lunch. "And don't stay out too late."

"I won't," I promised, feeling only slightly guilty about the deception.

I told Phrolova I was visiting family and would miss our usual practice session. She seemed disappointed but understanding.

"Bring me back a story," she said with a smile. "Something interesting happens on every journey, even the boring ones."

If only she knew.

The expedition to the mill ruins went exactly as planned, right up until it didn't.

I set out early in the morning, with a packed lunch and my small exploration kit. The weather was perfect—clear skies, gentle breeze, the kind of day that made you believe nothing bad could happen.

I'd timed everything carefully. The patrol wasn't supposed to leave until afternoon, which would give me plenty of time to explore the ruins and be in position when they arrived. I'd see the Tacet Discords, my powers would awaken, and by evening I'd be back in the village as a hero.

The ruins were even more impressive than I'd remembered. The mill itself was long gone, but the stone foundation remained, twisted into impossible spirals by whatever Lament had struck the area. Arches that should have collapsed decades ago hung in the air like frozen music, and the old millstone sat in the center of it all, slowly rotating without any visible mechanism.

"This is incredible," I breathed, setting down my pack to examine the twisted stonework. "It's like someone took architecture and turned it into art."

The Lament effects were fascinating, and I found myself drawn deeper into the ruins, exploring every twisted arch and impossible angle. No signs of Tacet Discords yet, but the metallic taste in the air was getting stronger.

That's when I saw them.

Three shapes moving through the ruins, too fluid to be human, too purposeful to be natural phenomena. Tacet Discords, just as the merchants had reported. Small ones, but still dangerous.

And they had noticed me.

This was it. The moment I'd been planning for. My powers would awaken, the patrol would arrive, and everything would work out perfectly.

Except the patrol was nowhere to be seen.

And the Tacet Discords were getting closer.

And I was completely alone.

This was fine. This was still part of the plan. My powers would awaken any moment now, and everything would be—

One of the Tacet Discords lunged toward me.

That's when I realized I'd made a terrible mistake.

There was no patrol coming. I'd misheard the timing, or maybe they'd changed their plans, or maybe I'd just been so focused on creating the perfect scenario that I'd ignored the possibility that things might go wrong.

I was alone, facing three Tacet Discords, and I was the only one who could do anything about it.

Time to find out if I really was the protagonist of this story.

Famous last words, right there.## 

Section 4: The Awakening Disaster (Age 6)

I was six when I learned the difference between reading about near-death experiences and having one.

The moment I stepped between Phrolova and the Tacet Discords, something inside me snapped into focus. Not awakened—that wasn't the right word. More like something that had been waiting patiently in the back of my mind suddenly decided it was time to make itself known.

The world exploded into information.

Every surface, every shadow, every particle of dust in the air suddenly carried data that flooded into my consciousness like a dam bursting. I could see the Tacet Discords' resonance frequencies, their energy patterns, their structural weaknesses. I could analyze their movement patterns and predict their next actions with mathematical precision.

But more than that, I could see everything else.

The twisted stone arches weren't just architectural curiosities—they were resonance amplifiers, still humming with Lament energy that made them perfect conductors for certain types of frequency manipulation. The millstone's rotation wasn't random—it was following a pattern that corresponded to the local reality distortions, acting as a stabilizing anchor for the area's warped physics.

And Phrolova...

Oh god, Phrolova.

She blazed like a star in my enhanced vision. Where everyone else in the village had appeared as dim outlines, barely registering on whatever scale my ability used to measure importance, she was a beacon of pure narrative significance. Power radiated from her in waves that I could actually see, complex harmonics that spoke of potential so vast it made my head spin.

But there was something wrong with the resonance. Something dark and twisted at its core, like a beautiful melody played in a minor key that spoke of tragedy and loss. It was dormant now, sleeping, but I could see the potential for something terrible in her future.

She was important to this world's story, that much was clear. But as I watched her stand there, violin clutched protectively to her chest, tears streaming down her face as she stared at the approaching Tacet Discords, I realized I had no idea what kind of story she was meant to tell.

The realization hit me at the same time as the sensory overload. Blood began streaming from my nose as my six-year-old brain tried to process information it wasn't equipped to handle. The Tacet Discords' attack patterns, Phrolova's awakening power signature, the resonance feedback from the twisted architecture—all of it crashed together in my skull like competing orchestras playing different songs at maximum volume.

"Caspian!" Phrolova's voice seemed to come from very far away, even though she was right behind me. "What's happening to you?"

What was happening was that I was dying. The blood wasn't just coming from my nose anymore—I could taste it in my mouth, feel it running from my ears. My vision was fracturing into kaleidoscope patterns as my ability tried to analyze everything at once.

But through the chaos, I could see what needed to happen.

The Tacet Discords were drawn to movement and sound. But they were also vulnerable to specific frequency disruptions. If I could just...

But I was six years old and bleeding from every orifice. Knowledge without the ability to act on it was useless.

The creatures circled me, their forms shifting and writhing as they prepared to attack. My power showed me their attack patterns, their weaknesses, everything I needed to know to fight them—but what good was perfect analysis when I was too small and weak to do anything with the information?

That's when I heard the sound of hoofbeats.

The patrol. They'd come after all, just later than I'd expected. Shouts filled the air as armed villagers charged into the ruins, weapons drawn and ready for battle.

"There's a child in there!" someone yelled—I think it was the blacksmith, but my vision was too fractured to be sure.

Strong hands grabbed me, lifting me away from the Tacet Discords as the real fighters engaged the creatures. I caught glimpses of the battle through my fading consciousness—flashes of steel, bursts of resonance energy from the few villagers who had awakened abilities, the inhuman shrieks of the Tacet Discords as they fought back.

Through it all, I kept my mouth shut about what I could see. The analysis data flooding my brain, the way I could read their attack patterns and weaknesses—none of the adults needed to know about that. They were handling the situation just fine without input from a bleeding six-year-old.

I'd been wrong about everything. Wrong about the timing, wrong about needing to awaken my powers to be useful, wrong about my own role in whatever story this world was telling.

The last thing I saw before unconsciousness took me was the patrol finishing off the last Tacet Discord, their weapons gleaming with residual resonance energy.

I'd been saved. But not by awakening powers or heroic destiny.

I'd been saved by adults doing their job while one stupid child learned the hard way that the world didn't revolve around his fantasies.

And I was bleeding out in the dirt, having learned that sometimes the most important lesson you can learn is that you're not as important as you think you are.

I woke up three days later in the village healer's hut, with the worst headache of either of my lives and the absolute certainty that I was the biggest idiot who had ever lived.

"You're awake," Mom said, relief evident in her voice. She was sitting beside my bed, looking like she hadn't slept since I'd been brought in. "How do you feel?"

"Like I got hit by a truck," I croaked, then had to explain what a truck was when she looked confused.

"The healer says you had some kind of resonance feedback," Dad said from the corner of the room. "Sometimes happens to children who get too close to Tacet Discord activity. The chaotic frequencies can overwhelm young minds. You're lucky to be alive."

Lucky. Right. If only they knew what had really happened.

"How did the patrol find me?" I asked.

"They were doing their sweep of the ruins when they heard the commotion," Mom explained. "Found you unconscious and bleeding. You'd wandered off the path to your cousin's place, hadn't you?"

I nodded weakly. Let them think it was an accident, that I'd just gotten lost and stumbled into danger. It was better than explaining that I'd deliberately sought out the Tacet Discords.

"The healer says the bleeding was from resonance exposure," Dad continued. "Your brain couldn't handle the chaotic frequencies. But you should recover fully with rest."

They had no idea that my ability had awakened. No idea that the "resonance feedback" was actually my power trying to analyze everything at once. And I wasn't about to tell them.

Of course she had. Because that's what protagonists do—they save people. Even idiotic supporting characters who get them into trouble in the first place.

"I want to see her," I said.

"Tomorrow," Mom said firmly. "You need to rest. And we need to talk about what you were thinking, taking her out there without proper supervision."

What I was thinking. How could I explain that I'd been thinking like a character in a story instead of a real person in a real world? How could I tell them that I'd nearly gotten us both killed because I'd confused genre conventions with actual life?

I couldn't. So I just nodded and closed my eyes, pretending to sleep while I tried to process what had happened.

My ability—this "Resonance Analysis" that had awakened so catastrophically—was still there. I could feel it lurking in the back of my mind, ready to flood me with information if I let it. But now I understood the cost. The blood, the pain, the overwhelming sensory input that had nearly killed me.

And I understood something else, too. Something that made my stomach clench with a fear that had nothing to do with Tacet Discords or awakening abilities.

In those few moments when my power had been fully active, I'd seen everyone's "narrative importance." The villagers, the patrol members, even my own parents—they'd all registered as background characters, bit players in someone else's story.

But Phrolova... Phrolova had blazed like the sun. She was the center of everything, the point around which all other stories revolved. And there had been something else in that blazing light—something that spoke of endings rather than beginnings, of destruction rather than salvation.

Which meant that being close to her, being part of her story, was the most dangerous thing I could possibly do.

Because in every novel I'd ever read, the people closest to the villain were the ones who ended up paying the price for their choices. And I was starting to suspect that Phrolova's story wasn't going to have a happy ending.

And I'd just learned that this wasn't a novel. This was real life, where bleeding out in the dirt wasn't a dramatic plot point—it was just dying.

I was six years old, and I'd learned the most important lesson of my life: distance equals survival.

What I didn't know yet was that I wasn't just a bystander in Phrolova's story. I was the protagonist of my own—the one person who might be able to change how her story ended.

But that realization was still ten years away.

Now I just had to figure out how to live with the knowledge that my childhood friend might be destined to become something terrible.## Sectio
n 5: Personality Death and Transformation (Age 6+)

They say trauma changes people.

What they don't tell you is that sometimes it kills them entirely, leaving someone else wearing their face.

The boy who woke up in that healer's hut looked like Caspian, sounded like Caspian, and answered to Caspian's name. But the child who had dreamed of adventures and believed in his own protagonist status was gone, replaced by someone who understood that the world was not a story and he was not its hero.

The recovery period was the worst part. Not the physical healing—that was straightforward enough. Resonance feedback, the healer explained, was a known phenomenon among newly awakened Resonators. Painful, dangerous, but treatable with rest and careful monitoring.

No, the worst part was watching my parents try to understand what had happened to their son.

"He's so quiet now," I heard Mom whisper to Dad one evening, thinking I was asleep. "He used to chatter constantly about everything he saw and did. Now he barely speaks unless we ask him direct questions."

"The healer said personality changes are common after traumatic awakenings," Dad replied, but his voice carried the same worry. "Maybe it's just temporary."

It wasn't temporary. The chattering, curious child who had seen the world as an adventure waiting to happen was gone. In his place was someone who understood that curiosity killed more than cats, and that adventures were just a polite word for situations where people died.

When I was finally allowed visitors, Phrolova was the first to come.

She knocked on the door frame of the healer's hut, violin case slung over her shoulder as always, and gave me the same bright smile that had drawn me to her in the first place.

"Caspian! You're awake! I've been so worried about you."

"Hello, Phrolova," I said politely, not getting up from my bed. "Thank you for worrying."

She blinked at my tone—formal, distant, nothing like the enthusiastic friend she'd known before. "Are you... are you alright? I mean, besides the obvious. Your parents said you got lost on the way to your cousin's and ran into Tacet Discords."

"I'm fine," I lied. "Just learned a valuable lesson about staying on marked paths."

"I brought my violin," she said, holding up the case hopefully. "I thought maybe we could play something together. Music always makes you feel better."

The offer hit me like a physical blow. Music. The thing that had connected us, that had made me believe we were partners in some grand adventure. The thing that had led me to seek out danger in the first place.

"I don't think that's a good idea," I said carefully. "I'm still recovering. The healer says I should avoid anything that might trigger another resonance episode."

It was true, technically. The healer had warned about overstimulation during the recovery period. But that wasn't why I was refusing.

I was refusing because I'd seen something in my awakened vision that terrified me. The dark potential blazing around Phrolova like a promise of future tragedy. And I'd realized that being close to that kind of destiny, being part of that story, was a death sentence for anyone who wasn't prepared for what was coming.

"Oh," she said, and I could hear the hurt in her voice. "I... I understand. Maybe when you're feeling better?"

"Maybe," I said, knowing I would never feel better. Not in the way she meant.

She lingered for a few more minutes, trying to make conversation, but my responses were polite and brief. Eventually, she gave up and left, promising to visit again soon.

I watched her go and felt something die inside my chest. Not dramatically—there was no moment of anguish or despair. Just a quiet recognition that the friendship we'd shared was over, killed by my newfound understanding of how the world really worked.

The visits continued over the following weeks. Phrolova would come by every few days, always hopeful, always trying to recapture the connection we'd once shared. And every time, I would be polite, distant, and careful not to give her any reason to think things could go back to the way they were.

"You're different," she said finally, during what would turn out to be her last visit. "Ever since the ruins, you've been different. Did I do something wrong?"

The question broke my heart, because the answer was no. She hadn't done anything wrong. She'd been exactly what she was supposed to be—a protagonist awakening to her power, saving the day, becoming the hero the world needed.

The problem was me. The problem was that I'd finally understood my place in the story, and it wasn't beside her.

"You didn't do anything wrong," I said truthfully. "I just... I think I need some time to figure things out."

"Time," she repeated, and I could see her trying to understand. "How much time?"

Forever, I thought. But I couldn't say that to her six-year-old face, couldn't explain that I was protecting both of us by staying away.

"I don't know," I said instead. "I'm sorry, Phrolova. I really am."

She left that day with tears in her eyes, and I let her go. Because that was what supporting characters did when they finally understood their role—they stepped aside and let the protagonist find their real story.

The months that followed were a blur of careful reconstruction. I threw myself into studying everything I could about survival in this world. Not adventure, not heroics—survival. I learned about Tacet Discord behavior patterns, about safe travel routes, about the warning signs that preceded Lament events. I memorized the locations of every settlement within a hundred miles of Ostina, along with their defensive capabilities and evacuation procedures.

My parents were worried, but they adapted. They started including me in their business discussions, teaching me about trade routes and merchant protocols. They seemed to think that focusing on practical matters would help me recover from whatever trauma I'd experienced.

They weren't wrong, exactly. Learning about the family business did help—not because it healed anything, but because it gave me a framework for the life I was planning to live. A quiet life. A safe life. A life where I would inherit the wool trade, marry some nice merchant's daughter, and die peacefully in my bed at a ripe old age, having successfully avoided every adventure that came my way.

It was a good plan. A smart plan. A plan that would keep me alive.

The only problem was Phrolova.

She didn't give up easily. Even after I'd made it clear that our friendship was over, she kept trying. She would wave when she saw me in the village square. She would ask my parents how I was doing when they visited her family's stall. She would play her violin in the evening, sitting on the steps of the village hall where we used to make music together, and I knew she was hoping I would hear and come join her.

I never did.

But I listened. From my bedroom window, from the shadows between buildings, from anywhere I could hear her music without being seen. And every time, it was more beautiful than before. More complex, more powerful, more obviously supernatural.

She was growing into her abilities. Becoming the protagonist she was meant to be.

And I was learning to live with the knowledge that I could never be part of that story.

"Distance equals survival," I whispered to myself one evening, listening to her play a melody that made the stars seem brighter. "Distance equals survival."

It became my mantra, my guiding principle, my most important rule. Stay away from the main character. Avoid the plot. Live quietly, safely, and alone.

I was six years old, and I'd learned the most important lesson of my life.

I just wished it didn't hurt so much to live by it.
