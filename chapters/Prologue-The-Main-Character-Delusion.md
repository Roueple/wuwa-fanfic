# Prologue: "The Main Character Delusion"

Sword and magic, isekai world—isn't it every man's dream to reincarnate there? Become the hero, defeat the evil, marry the princess. When I first realized I'd been reincarnated into a fantasy world, I was ecstatic, thrilled by what I could become.

*"Holy shit, I actually did it! I'm in a fantasy world! This is it—this is my chance to be somebody!"*

Rather than the boring life on Earth—cubicle work, microwave dinners, dying alone in some apartment—this new world was full of adventures waiting to happen. I learned about the Laments from Dad's old books, heard adults whisper about Tacet Discords, discovered that reality-warping disasters could reshape entire landscapes overnight. 

*"Reality-warping disasters? Monsters made of chaos? This is so much cooler than filing quarterly reports!"*

It was everything I'd ever dreamed of in those fantasy novels I'd binged during lunch breaks.

The problem was, I had no idea what kind of world this actually was.

I learned the name "Solaris-3" from village adults. Figured out what Tacet Discords were through trial and error. Discovered the danger of Laments by reading dusty history books.

*"Tacet Discords... even the name sounds ominous. No wonder everyone's so afraid of them."*

No special knowledge. No future sight. No advantages.

Just the excitement of remembering my past life in a world full of magic and adventure, and the naive belief that being a protagonist was about wanting it badly enough.

*"How hard could it be, right? Fantasy world, magic powers, become the hero. Simple."*

Dangers? Please. I had protagonist plot armor. I'd awaken some incredible power, save the day, and everyone would cheer my name.

Here I come! Caspian the protagonist! HAHAHAHAHA!

---

Three years later, I was running for my life when I realized I'd been wrong about everything.

The Vanguard's crude blade whistled past my ear, close enough to feel the displaced air. My lungs burned as I stumbled through the twisted merchant road, dodging between the reality-warped trees that grew in impossible spirals.

AARGHHH! Shit, shit, SHIT!

*Where's my plot armor?! Where's my convenient power-up?!*

This wasn't how it was supposed to go. In every story I'd read, the protagonist's powers awakened during moments of crisis. The hero emerged victorious. There was supposed to be a pattern, a logic to it all.

"Come on, come on, THINK! There has to be something—"

But as the creature's shriek echoed behind me and my six-year-old legs gave out, I understood with crystal clarity that I'd confused fiction with reality.

"I'm gonna die. Oh god, I'm actually gonna die. This is so stupid—why did I think I was special?!"

The lead Vanguard landed in front of me, cutting off my escape. Its humanoid form flickered with chaotic energy, the crude weapon in its hands shifting between blade and club. Behind me, I could hear the other two Tacet Discords closing in—their footsteps unnaturally synchronized.

"No, no, NO! This can't be how it ends!"

*This was it. The end of my second chance at life. All those dreams, all that confidence—*

"I don't want to die! I don't want to—"

Then something inside me snapped.

The world exploded into information. Every surface, every shadow, every particle of dust suddenly carried data that flooded my consciousness like a dam bursting. I could see the creatures' resonance frequencies, their structural weaknesses, their attack patterns with mathematical precision.

But more than that—I could see how to exploit them.

My body moved without conscious thought. I rolled left as the first Vanguard lunged, its weapon scraping stone where I'd been. The second one came from behind, but I was already spinning, my hand grabbing a jagged piece of broken stone and driving it into the exact point where its Tacet Core was most vulnerable.

The Vanguard shrieked and dissolved into dissipating frequency energy.

The remaining two circled me warily. Through my enhanced vision, I could see their confusion—how had a child just killed one of their kind?

*What the hell is happening to me?*

I didn't know either. But the knowledge was there, burning in my skull like molten metal. Every weakness, every vulnerability, every way to make them suffer.

"Come on then!" I heard myself snarl. "COME ON!"

The fight lasted three minutes. When it was over, I stood alone among the dissolving frequency remnants of three Vanguard-class Tacet Discords, blood streaming from my nose and ears, my small hands shaking with residual energy.

"I... I won? I actually won?"

*Wait. Where's the victory music? Where's the sense of accomplishment? Why do I feel like—*

"Fuck, fuck, FUCK!"

*In fiction they say protagonists grow stronger in danger. Nobody told me it's also traumatic as fuck.*

The despair hit me like a physical blow. I'd been so close to death that I could still taste it. The fear, the helplessness, the absolute certainty that I was about to die—it clung to me like a second skin.

"This isn't... this isn't how it works in the stories..."

*Where's the rush of victory? Where's the sense of destiny fulfilled? Why does everything hurt so much?*

"I almost died. I almost fucking DIED!"

*Next time I might not be so lucky. Next time—oh god, what if there's a next time?*

I collapsed to my knees and vomited until there was nothing left.

*"Of course I'd remember my past life in a world I know absolutely nothing about. Just my fucking luck."*

"God, I was such an idiot..."

*"I thought being special was about wanting it badly enough. Turns out the world doesn't give a shit what you want."*

I wiped the blood from my mouth with a shaking hand, staring at the empty space where the Tacet Discords had been.

*"You know what? Fuck being special. Fuck adventures. Fuck being the protagonist."*

"I want to go home," I whispered to the empty road. "I want to help Dad with the wool. I want to eat Mom's cooking. I want to die peacefully in my bed at ninety, surrounded by grandchildren who think I'm boring."

*"Better boring than dead, right? Right?"*

I stared at the dissolving frequency remnants where the Vanguards had been, my hands still shaking.

*"Living ordinary... it must be easier than this. It has to be."*

But even as I thought it, something cold settled in my stomach. A nagging doubt that whispered maybe—just maybe—ordinary wasn't as simple as I hoped.

*"Right?"*

The silence of the twisted forest was my only answer.
