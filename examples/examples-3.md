The First Step into Murim


For production workers at small and medium enterprises, making games was a basic skill.


Of course, depending on the person, there were some that they didnt acknowledge as games. By that, they meant mobile phone applications that only involved automatic hunting, in-app purchases, and gacha could not be recognized as an actual game. 


However, for such production workers, these games held a value beyond just being games.


Werent they the reliable genre that allowed one to level up solidly even while working inside a cabinet?


While the salary might not increase, the joy of leveling up was still by their side.


Moreover, these games accounted for over 70% of the conversation among team members, so it could be said that it was more akin to their modern social life than mere gaming.


However, when limited to PC or console games, gaming was a somewhat distant hobby for production workers. Their hobbies were usually drinking alcohol (casually, with a meal), drinking alcohol (company dinners), drinking alcohol (with women), and if it wasnt any of that, then at most, fishing. That was mainstream.


In that sense, his hobby of gaming was quite uncommon. 


He was a diligent gamer.


The nature of his job in production meant that a basic two-shift system was in place, with short cycles of day and night shifts, granting short vacations of 2 nights and 2 days or 1 night and 2 days.


During these breaks, he would first sleep like the dead, then sit in front of his monitor with a cold beer in a thermos, sipping as he spent his vacation time.


He wasnt particularly picky about his games.


In the games, he enjoyed many different characters. Sometimes, he lived the life of an outlaw of the wastelands, traversing the West, and at other times, as a commander with superhuman abilities, stopping alien invasions and destroying several planets before ultimately saving one.


He also found it quite enjoyable to be the rebellious Son of God, who had ultimately killed God.


However, most of his gaming experiences involved playing as a knight or a wizard in a somewhat medieval, Western cultural setting.


And amidst his fun, someone commented on his post asking for game comments.


try out the Murim Chronicles: A Tale of Life and Death its hella fun


 shitty ching chong1sorry derogatory term game fuck off


 no listen;; its seriously hella fun;; theres even a korean patch. hey try it try it2korean meme


Murim, huh


His knowledge of Murim was limited to a few Stephen Chow movies. Like Shaolin Soccer.


Wasnt the ultimate technique thingy that appeared in Kung Fu Hustle called Buddhas Palm or something?


Now that he thought of it, his curiosity was piqued.


He didnt hesitate to buy the game.


After all, the wallet of a production worker living alone was honestly quite thick, so what reason was there not to?


While it was downloading, he searched for information about the game.


It was an open-world RPG made in China (Unofficial Korean Patch: 99.6% translated) with high degrees of freedom.


The fact that there was a user-created Korean patch guaranteed that there was at least some level of enjoyment. After all, who would go through the trouble of translating a boring game?


One could freely farm and grow until they reached a certain amount of Fame. Then, major events called Early-Game Crisis, Midgame Crisis, and Endgame Crisis would randomly start.


If one overcame these, they could see the ending. Additionally, they could keep playing afterward or finish and play another round as a descendant. The game offered multiple endings based on the content chosen.


He wasnt aware of the unfamiliar genre that was martial arts games, but upon searching, it seemed quite popular.


He was someone who preferred munchkin play, where he could wipe out enemies without reserve rather than overcoming difficult challenges. He liked to follow the strongest validated build and enjoy the game comfortably.


As he looked up character-making and build recommendation posts, he pondered how to grow his character.


Since he already had a feeling that it would be fun, he looked forward to it with a satisfied smile.


Soon the game installation was completed and he overlaid the Korean patch file. 


And then, it was time for the long-awaited start of the game.


Using the knowledge from the posts he had read just before, he proceeded quickly with the character creation.


The difficulty would be Traveler of Tasteful Leisure (Easy Difficulty).


Since the game supported multiple rounds, he thought if it was fun, he could raise the difficulty in the second round.


The Constitution of the character would be Blood Poison, known to make gameplay much more comfortable.


The Star of Destiny would be the Heavenly Slaughtering Star.


And without any hesitation, the gender would be female.


He firmly believed that in any game where female characters were playable, one must always choose them.


Unfortunately, customization was not supported.


He had no choice but to choose an illustration with big breasts from the given presets of appearance.


After all, shouldnt he at least show a well-formed figure in-game?   


When he took a break, smoking a cigarette and drinking beer, it was his guilty pleasure to enjoy the view of a female character with a big chest.


It was also a privilege of a single man.


And as for the characters name


  Ctrl+V.


(A-Qing)


The pre-copied Hanja characters were entered.


It was incomprehensible how someones name could be A-Qing.


But it was something mentioned in the recommendation post.


After all, entering this would start him off with one of the games most overpowered martial arts, the Sword Art of the Yue3It means moon, but because there will be differentiation later, I kept the chinese romanticization Yue Maiden, in its true form.


Now, the character creation was done.


Before pressing the Start Murim Journey button, he brought up a guide post on his smartphone that organized the route he needed to take in order to farm quickly before advancing to the early-game story. 


After all, if it was an open-world game, wasnt it a rule of thumb to farm generously as soon as it started before proceeding seriously?


However, in the end, the preparation was useless.


The moment he pressed the Start Murim Journey button-


He was standing in a chilly cave


Along with a hefty mass that suddenly weighed on his upper body.

Chapter 1: A Day In The Life Of A Second-Year Martial Artist (1)

A Day In The Life Of A Second-Year Martial Artist (1)


A-Qing was currently an inhabitant of Murim, as well as a former member of the modern age.


This fact brought a significant enlightenment to A-Qing. 


The life of a once single, production worker of the modern era meant that work and people were sometimes (often) shitty. As such, this led to ones well-being deteriorating, as they endured the hardship of not being able to sleep when desired, constantly rubbing at exhausted eyes.


However, there were no problems when it came to just living.


Modern civilization meant that even when one lived alone, basic needs were manageable and they could survive without particularly feeling any life-threatening dangers.


But what about the world of Murim, these primitive ancient times of China?


If one did not have power nor money, they would just die. There was no other option.


So, over the past year, A-Qings time here was a continuous, solemn struggle to preserve her very life.


At least the people of Korea didnt draw knives and attack just because they made eye contact or killed one another over a shoulder bump in a sword duel.


It was almost impossible for a modern person with a fragile spirit to survive in such a barbaric civilization.


Yet A-Qing was still alive and breathing.


Of course, she was fortunate in many ways.


Firstly, A-Qings body was robust.


In modern terms, he had followed a guide when creating a character, focusing on a build that went all-in on strength and stamina to get through the Early-Game. 


And when A-Qing opened her eyes, she found herself in the body of the character she had created.


She was stronger than most men and her steel-like body hardly tired.


And most importantly, the choice of Constitution was perfect.


A-Qings Constitution, Blood Poison, neutralized all poisons that existed in the narrative.


Even food poisoning was considered a poison, so she could eat anything without falling ill.


She could seriously eat anything without worries.


And so, A-Qing survived.


Since she could not even make eye contact with Third-Rate Unorthodox thugs, she fought over discarded food with beggars. As stealing potatoes and radishes was not easy, she was beaten by farmers.


Like that, she endured a year.


And now, she had become a proper martial artist in her second year at the Central Plains. 


In her own way, it was a special commemoration for A-Qing as well. 


Thats right, I too am a proper martial artist, now in my second year. I should try to live more like a martial artistMore like a human.


Even just now, she had brought in the head of a wanted villain to the administrative office and received the bounty.


She still vividly remembered the first time she killed someone in her first year here, crying and vomiting, but now she could cut through arms and necks without hesitation.


  At this rate, I am also turning into a splendid Murim gangster. Mmm. Nice.


A-Qings majestic chest swelled.


It was the pride of a Jianghu newbie, just a little over a year of life in the Central Plains.


Even if it wasnt A-Qing, about a year after one embarked on this martial path tended to be the time when confidence was at its peak.


Of course, it wasnt clear to A-Qing herself if she had really entered her second year.


After all, she didnt mark the days like a castaway on a deserted island or a kidnapping victim secluded in a dark room.


But she had fallen into this world in the warm spring, survived the winter, and now the weather was warming up again.


As such, it was roughly the 1st anniversary.


Humiliating days flashed through her mind.        


When she woke up naked in a completely unknown world, there was almost nothing A-Qing could do.


After all, did money grow on trees?


Or, like in a game, could she break into houses, shatter some jars, open boxes, and boldly steal in front of the homeowner?


Of course, if there was no owner, it was possible, and there were actually professionals who specialized in this.


However, burglary required more sophisticated skills than she thought, even if it was an empty house.


If she had known she would end up like this, she wouldnt have worked as a production worker but as a burglar instead.


Fortunately, there was one part that was the same as a game.


It was that killing people gave money.


In the Central Plains, people carried pouches called moneybags to hold their assets.


If the owner disappeared, the person who picked it up would become the next owner, so if you killed someone, you could rightfully inherit their moneybag.


Even so, A-Qing was always poor.


It was because she was not a murderous robber aiming for money.


If she had to kill, she killed only rotten bastards.


Sometimes, when she brought their heads to the office, she received a bounty, albeit rarely. But the amount earned was not that much either.


As soon as one left their nest and had to become a responsible adult, every little thing cost money.


To exaggerate a bit, even breathing costs money.


As such, life obviously couldnt help but be miserable.


But today, lets break free from being miserable.


It was a day she could celebrate with pride.


It was the 1st anniversary!


Over here, Server. 


At A-Qings call, the server rushed in.


There was a mole as big as a housefly beside his nose.


It was clear that this inn was not any ordinary inn.


After all, the mole on the servers face was a sign of fortune.


The bigger and clearer the mole, the higher the servers fee. One could tell the status of the inn by the servers mole.


Whats good here?


Theres nothing we cant cook, but the dish I recommend today is chicken steamed with ginger and then fried with dark soy sauce and oil. Today is the day the chickens came in from the cockfighting arena, so the flavor is extraordinary.


The server skillfully recommended a dish.


Starting at the age of fourteen and soon reaching his 30th anniversary here, the experienced server could immediately gauge the customer.


As she was wearing light robes with traces of Qi here and there, she must be a poor female swordsman of Murim. Though there were dark circles under her eyes, her expression was not one of exhaustion.


As such, it must be a customer who had something good happen, wishing to celebrate, and preferred a generous and oily dish over a small portion due to her poor attire.


Cockfighting arena and whatnot was purely bullshit.


In fact, the server did not know much about it either.


However, it was just a chicken dish, not even a duck.


This level of lip service was needed to satisfy the customer as well.


A-Qing, the second-year newbie of Murim lifestyle, had no idea what the server was thinking.


She was just happy. 


Chicken!


Fried chicken!


The soul food of Koreans!


Are you in need of alcohol as well?


Yes! One strong bottle of hard liquor!


Then how about Bi Hongju1a type of alcohol. 40% alcohol and known for its red color. In fact, in Hanja, the Hong stands for red and the -ju stands for alcohol. So basically, it can be called red liquor but thats no fun is it?? It is from the Bi Familys Brewery behind here. Although this is only their first generation, it is known for its extraordinary potency. Even the elderly of the Beggars Union praise it.


If it was only a first-generation brewery, it couldnt boast of making good liquor.


Moreover, the talk about the elderly of the Beggars Union was purely a scam.


How could beggars truly know the subtle tastes of liquor? They would just down it, after all.


In the end, it was all just talk.


But how that talk was packaged could please the customer.


The server was a high-class personnel and practically an artist in hospitality.


One fish-scented sweet and sour chicken here! One Bi Hongju!


The server shouted the order as he walked away.


Shouting the order wasnt to inform the kitchen. Nor was it to double-check with the customer.


It was to let the other clients in the inn know what this person ordered.


The more expensive the order, the louder the voice, and occasionally, when a really big customer came, they even went out to the main road to yell the order out.


However, A-Qings order was not loud enough for the server to raise his voice. It was simply because the server had clearly seen and read into A-Qings heart.


After all, it was obvious what a poor customer would expect.


Unaware of this consideration, A-Qing was all smiles.


The other customers in the inn who saw A-Qing also let out a smirk, as soon after, they had roughly realized what kind of situation this was.


A-Qing was the only one unaware.


A-Qing. A whopping two years spent in Murim.


- 


In the previous era, there was a song that a legendary band of chivalrous individuals (basically, akin to thieves) loved to sing.


The first verse was incomparably unique.


Heroes do not bother studying.


But the era of ignorant and unsophisticated sword swings had passed and in this new era, martial arts also became a branch of study.


The higher the level of martial arts, the more it entwined with the principles of the world.


In fact, without contemplating the Dao and ideology, one could not become a peerless Master.


However, the zenith of the era before the last, the Greatest Under Heaven, loved this song.


His title was the Celestial Martial Emperor.


It was a terrifying moniker. 


Even if he was the Greatest Under Heaven, how could he dare to impersonate the title of Emperor!? 


It was akin to challenging the Jade Emperor to a showdown.


So, they actually did fight.


As the stern Jade Emperor never avoided a challenge, a mere word of conspiracy would gather the military forces of all that was under Heaven.


And the result?


The Celestial Martial Emperor was truly fitting of his title.


If the Celestial Martial Emperor had been defeated, he would have been nicknamed something like The Small Fry Who Stood Against Heaven or Traitor to Heaven.


It was a famous tale that the Celestial Martial Emperor suppressed thirty thousand soldiers, grabbed the Emperor by the collar, climbed to the top of the Imperial Palace, and sang a revised version of his favorite song.


Heroes do not mind the gazes of others.


What does it matter when All Under Heaven is beneath me


Even if my status is humble



Who dares to hinder my path


Thus, the Celestial Martial Emperor succeeded in redefining the relationship between the authorities and the martial world, creating a new law that the two should ignore each other and mind their own business.


With that, the Celestial Martial Emperor ascended as the godfather of all martial artists.


Afterward, the Celestial Martial Emperor literally realized the legend of ascending to Heaven as a Daoist Immortal, leaving a legacy as an imperishable icon.


The musical achievement of composing the most beloved song of that eras martial artists was just a bonus. 


Truly the very definition of a man who shaped an era!


However, there were side effects.


Some people misunderstood the lyrics of the song Heroes do not mind the gazes of others.


If heroes did not mind the gazes of others, did it mean that those who were not heroes should mind them?


Then, bastards who were cautious of others werent heroes, right? 


The ascended Celestial Martial Emperor would have lamented up above Heaven, pounding his chest in frustration.


And as a result, here in this place


The Virtuous Gale of Qinghe2a place in the Hebei province, Jo Gaksan, thought of himself as a hero. 


Jo Gaksan was dining with his sworn brothers.


Together, with the three of them, they were known as the Virtuous Quartet of Qinghe and had a fair amount of pride in their renown.


Then he suddenly recognized a face.


The Ugly Devil of Zhengyou, Ahn Sung-il.


Despite his title, his looks were quite decent.


However, the nickname Ugly Devil of Zhengyou was not for his face but for his extremely vile and dirty deeds.


His main business was human trafficking, and besides that, he was a son of a bitch who committed all kinds of evil deeds such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, arson, and fraud.


Heroes must immediately punish evil without any tolerance.


Of course, only if the evil was weaker than them!


Ahn Sung-ils level was known to be in the early stages of the Peak Realm and Jo Gaksan was merely in the late stages of a First-Rate martial artist.


However, they were sworn brothers for such times. If not, what other reason would there be to uncomfortably move around in a group of four?


One against four.


  Each individual of the Virtuous Quartet of Qinghe might be weaker than Ahn Sung-il, but together, we were strong.


  Because that was what we are!


Indeed, they couldnt just stand by and watch evil get away!


Jo Gaksan finally made up his mind after calculating the odds from various angles.


Heroes do not mind the gazes of others.


The act of minding others gazes included causing a disturbance in a crowded inn during dinner time, potentially causing direct or indirect damage to those around.


Such minor collateral damage was trivial in the face of a grand cause that was executing justice and eliminating evil.


The Virtuous Quartet of Qinghe quietly exchanged glances.


Jo Gaksan tapped the table three times.


Then, they lunged forward all at once.
