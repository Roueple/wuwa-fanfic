Summary
After hearing from the Black Shores and Cartethyia, you learn that the residual energy of the Threnodian Leviathan still lingers in the distant depths of the sea. Time to investigate. You run into Fenrico in your voyage to locate the Threnodian's residual energy. He subtly suggests teaming up, perhaps even joining his cause, to fight a common enemy: the Fractsidus. Yet given the past events, you choose not to trust him and reject the offer, upon which Fenrico throws you into the sea.

You find yourself in a strange place beneath the sea, realizing it was Phrolova who had saved you. Though critically wounded and hunted by the Order, she risked her life to rescue you. She then reveals that Fenrico has the Threnodian's residual energy and offers a deal: since both of you seek to reclaim it from the Order, why not work together? Time is running out. With Phrolova injured and your surroundings unknown, cooperation seems to be the best option for both of you. The pursuers are closing in, and Phrolova is waiting for your answer... After accepting her proposal, you encounter a distorted door. Phrolova uses her Orchestration ability to briefly change its state as she explains how her ability works.

On your way, Phrolova doesn't even bat an eye at the death of her fellow Fractsidus members. You start to question how working with her will end. Phrolova, however, explains that every Fractsidus member has been braced for death since the day they joined. While some might see this as disregard for life, she sees it as truly understanding life's value—by facing death, they discover what they truly desire.

Phrolova suffers from another hallucination while using her ability despite her injury. This time, she is shown the chaotic, desperate minds of people from the past facing death. She comforts them, and after a brief moment of pain, she quickly recovers to continue the search for hope. Phrolova points you toward the Lost Beyond, where the Threnodian's residual energy lies. She reveals all she has done here and tells you about Fenrico's betrayal and his plot against her. Their broken alliance with the Order forced her to temporarily seal the Threnodian's energy within the Beyond. It significantly diminished her power, leaving her vulnerable and thus injured.

You reach the key area where Common Echoes are created. Phrolova warns you to avoid the dangerous mists, but the two of you disagree on which path to take. You find the Echo Brooders where Common Echoes are being incubated. Phrolova explains how it all functions, before the newly created echoes attacks the both of you. You question how Phrolova knew of the Echo attack in advance, to which she explains she heard a restless discordance and much more. Fragmented whispers echo in her ears.

Just as Phrolova tries to use her ability, a sudden hallucination shatters her focus. Visions of close people from the past fill her mind. She realizes that the Threnodian's residual energy she sealed away is now causing disturbances in the Lost Beyond. Phrolova's Orchestration has restored the area, but overusing her ability plunges her exhausted mind into more hallucinations. She finds herself beside her loved ones, playing music and sharing laughter as they accept her every word. She then faints, thinking the long-awaited death has finally come for her, but you bring her back.

You find recordings that reveal Fenrico's scheme to seize the Lost Beyond and the Threnodian's residual energy, which seems to contradict his previous commands. Fenrico appears to notice his abnormality. When Phrolova points out that Fenrico is in disarray, you suspect he has fallen under the Threnodian's influence. You then seize the moment to ask Phrolova about her true reason for creating the Lost Beyond. She simply replies that it was but to keep a distant promise and satisfy an obsession.

You realize Phrolova is recovering as she uses her abilities more to find a way out. This means the partnership based on her injuries is shattering. Meanwhile, Phrolova continues to see visions while using her ability, and indication to her that the situation in the Lost Beyond is deteriorating, as she and the space are closely connected.

An accidentally triggered security system separates you and Phrolova. She proposes splitting up to speed up the search. You worry that this might be a trap set by her and Fenrico. To ease your doubts, Phrolova hands you her baton, which holds her remaining Resonance Energy, her only support in her current state. After some thought, you accept her baton and go your separate ways.

You find a piece of sheet music and prepare to meet up with Phrolova, but Abby warns you about her strange frequency. Given the unpredictable dangers of the underwater environment, you tell Abby to return to your Tacet Mark but to stay alert. While searching for the sheet music, Phrolova encounters The Grand Architect of Fractsidus, who has taken the form of Triss. The Grand Architect suggests that with the unexpected turbulence in the sea depths, plans for the Lost Beyond should be set aside for now. Instead, trapping you to secure the Threnodian's residual energy has become the new priority. Phrolova considers this and then accepts the Grand Architect's command.

The Lost Beyond's influence on Phrolova intensifies. Visions of people from the past and promises fill her mind... Some voices urge her to yield, but she refuses to give in. Out of stubbornness, she believes the world is but a symphony of resonating frequencies. Humans may fall to be Tacet Discords, and Tacet Discords may rise again as humans—all are but vessels with no true boundaries.

Reuniting with Phrolova, an explosion blocks off the elevator to the upper floors. She instead decides to use her ability to amplify the blast, creating a greater shock wave to propel the two of you upward. You return Phrolova her baton, and in turn, she hands you all the sheet music pieces and entrusts you with the Orchestration. Taking the conductor's baton yourself is the only way to believe in what's unfolding in this place and decide how you both will move forward.

On your way to the Lumen Tower, some interference makes you stray from the correct path. You find yourself in an unknown location full of ensnared Acolytes. With no way out, Phrolova points out that disguising yourselves as Acolytes is the only viable option. You follow a group of Acolytes to a statue, where an altar holds the lantern of Napoli the Second. Upon touching it, you are suddenly teleported into an illusive realm. You come across an Orchestration Altar. You suggest Phrolova handle the Orchestration while you search the area for any useful clues.

Reading through the files you found, you uncover a hidden truth: the Dark Tide has long shackled the subconscious of the Ragunnesis. Only by defeating the Harbinger and bringing back all the trapped souls can it be resisted. Fenrico's pursuit of the Threnodian's energy and the Lost Beyond is actually an attempt to use them to house the Ragunnesi's subconscious and fend off the Dark Tide's invasion. But who is this Harbinger? Something seems to be hampering Fenrico's plans. Could there be other hidden risks to his actions?

During a fight, you lose trace of Phrolova and end up in an unknown location. You speculate that this is the Lost Beyond Phrolova spoke about. She likely forced open the path here after sensing the seal's failure and the Order's intrusion. Unsure of Phrolova's whereabouts, you decide to focus on stopping the Order and locating the Threnodian's residual energy yourself. You meet Phrolova in her past self and some others who know her. You try to ask them about the location of the Threnodian's residual energy, but you are a complete stranger to them, and they have no idea what you are seeking.

Inside Phrolova's home, you find some notes confirming the previous research files were hers. They also mention a "friend" and "anchor" that meant a great deal to her. Before you can figure out who and what they are, your surroundings begin to shift, prompting you to search elsewhere. The people you just encountered have transformed into TDs, still repeating the same words. You finally realize that Phrolova is attempting to use the Gem to fuse the bodies of Tacet Discords with human consciousness, hoping to bring them back to life and fulfill her seemingly impossible obsession. However, her attempts have yet to succeed, and these Reverberations have never truly become human.

In your search for the Threnodian's residual energy, you meet a mirage of Phrolova. She seems overwhelmed by conflicting emotions but eventually manages to get a grip on herself. She mentions her violin, something that holds special significant to her. It is her ambition, her companion, and the most precious Gem among all she has. You can't help but wonder if her words hold a hidden clue. Upon finding the violin and trying to grab it, you find yourself in a flashback through Phrolova's perspective.

You experience her conversation with Cristoforo back in Septimont and realize why she handed you the script: Cartethyia's intervention had made their plans to overwrite reality almost impossible. To maintain control of the Threnodian's power, they made a last-minute adjustment, shifting their focus to this underwater location ahead of schedule. Giving you the script was a way to leverage your power to progress the story until the power could be separated from Mya and returned to their grasp. The second Flashback of Phrolova, this time, you find yourself talking with Fenrico in Ragunna, revealing the true reason for the Fractsidus's involvement in the Carnevale: Deepening people's beliefs helps Leviathan gather and amplify Its power, paving the way for a successful separation of the Divinity, a shared goal between the Order and the Fractsidus. The Order has invested far too much to see it fail, and having the Fractsidus ruin the Carnevale would only solidify the Order's rule. When Phrolova saw your arrival, she realized they could use you to help complete the Divinity's separation. In Phrolova's third flashback, you see her and Scar in Jinzhou, standing before a hatching Ovathrax. Her presence in Norfall Barrens was mostly for personal reasons. Despite the Grand Architect's orders, she cared little about Jinzhou or you. She was more there for the countless Reverberations of the dead scattered across the battlefields. Experimenting with merging Reveberations and Tacet Discords there could offer valuable insight for the ultimate success of the Lost Beyond. The fourth flashback takes you back to your first true meeting with Phrolova in the concert hall. You sense the sorrow from the music, listen to her story, and can't help but offer her suggestions, inspiring her. After the conversation, you wonder if the path Phrolova chose was influenced by your words. Had you inadvertently led her astray? You begin to suspect you are the "friend" she mentioned, yet at the same time, you wonder if any of this truly happened. In the last vision, you witness Phrolova's conversation with the Grand Architect of Fractsidus, who appeared as her audience. By briefly shifting to Triss, he showed Phrolova a glimpse of rebirth, thus persuading her to join the Fractsidus. Having endured countless failures, Phrolova accepted. As you watch this past version of Phrolova move toward the darkness, you try to stop her from going down the wrong path.

Suddenly, the present Phrolova reveals herself. You notice something is off and stop her plan to trap you. You question whether what you just saw was real, but she refuses to answer, only replying that there is nothing you can do to change the present, whether it was real or not. You continue your way to the Gem and Fenrico.

After fighting Fenrico, who had become Leviathan's puppet, he is awakened by the visions of his predecessors appearing in the lantern's light. After regaining consciousness, Fenrico exhausts his powers to seal the gateway to the Journeying Paradise, blocking the Dark Tide. With the Threnodian's residual energy separated, you and Phrolova both race for the Gem. You tell her that the dead cannot be brought back and she should abandon her fantasies. Phrolova scoffs at your words, calling you the stubborn one and scorning your inability to step beyond the boundary that death has placed upon the human soul yourself. Unable to convince each other, the rivalry between you and Phrolova continues. Phrolova ends up falling into the nearby water while Cristoforo, with the help of Scar's abilities, takes the Gem and escapes.

In his last moments of consciousness, Fenrico reminds you that the Threnodian's residual energy isn't the real problem. Rinascita's woes lie in the "Journeying Paradise." He hopes you can prevent this impending calamity and save Rinascita. With this new information, you cease your search for the Threnodian's residual energy and instead plan to return to Septimont for further investigation. As you take one last look at the Frabricatorium of the Deep, wondering what to do with it, a Lycoris suddenly catches your eye.

Upon touching the Lycoris, you arrive at a place you have never been before. You discover a path that leads to the Lost Beyond and, thanks to Abby's reminder, realize that the Lost Beyond has now completely merged with Phrolova. She is still alive.

Breen the Screen: Still buzzing about the last Great Agon? Can't wait to see your Gladiators in action again?
Breen the Screen: The Open Tournament is on the horizon, and the qualifiers are underway! This is your chance to witness the rise of new legends!
Breen the Screen: Solis is bringing you live coverage of every match, and best of all, drinks are on the house for the entire tournament!
Breen the Screen: Come grab a seat and enjoy at Solis!
Abby: Qualifiers, huh? Sounds like a blast.
Rover: Want to check it out?
Abby: Heck yeah! Free drinks? I'm there!
Rover: I thought you wanted to watch the matches...
Abby: And we will! Just with a drink in hand. Come on, let's get going!
(Head to Solis Tavern)
Agon Broadcast: By the end of this match, the Scratchy will have extended their winning streak to 21. Despite the name, this team of young outlanders has made it this far without a single scratch.
Agon Broadcast: And their next challenge? Vulcan Mining, one of Septimont's most established teams. Will victory smile on the Scratchy once again? Stay tuned...
Abby: Hm? Who's calling?
Rover: It's from the Black Shores... Let's fine a quieter spot.
Black Shores Member: (Rover), we have Cartethyia's inspection report here.
 Have you figured out what happened to her?
Black Shores Member: Unfortunately, not yet.
Black Shores Member: Since this case is unprecedented, we'll need more time to fully understand it. But we've confirmed a few things.
Black Shores Member: After merging the power of the Sentinel and the Threnodian, she subconsciously absorbs nearby energy whenever she uses her Forte.
Black Shores Member: Last time, she fought in a Sonoro Sphere tainted by the Dark Tide. This may explain why she felt the Threnodian's pull growing stronger.
 Perhaps this is exactly what the Fractsidus was after.
Cartethyia: I'm alright. Please don't worry about me.
Cartethyia: No challenge is too great when your will is strong!
Black Shores Member: Trust in science for a simpler solution, Miss Cartethyia.
Black Shores Member: For now, she should avoid using her Forte.
Black Shores Member: Based on the data you sent back, the Inverted Tower may be the ideal place for her recovery.
 Because of Imperator?
Black Shores Member: Yes. That Sonoro Sphere's formation is connected to Imperator, which should help stabilize Cartethyia's energy.
Black Shores Member: Also, during her examination earlier, Cartethyia sensed traces of the Leviathan's residual energy again.
 Again?
Cartethyia: Yes. It felt the same as the power I sensed when fighting Mya.
Cartethyia: I couldn't pinpoint the source, but it seemed to come from somewhere south of the Black Shores, deep underwater.
 We need to verify that.
Black Shores Member: We're narrowing down the search. Once we have a location, we'll inform you immediately.
 I'll set out now. Just send me the rough coordinates.
Black Shores Member: ...Understood. I'll notify our contact to arrange transport for you.
Black Shores Member: Please be very careful.
Rover: (Energy similar to the Threnodian's power in Mya's body... Does that mean Mya wasn't the only one?)
Abby: So, where to next?
Rover: The dock. It's time to set sail.
(Head to the dock)
Black Shores Member: (Rover), we've located the source of the residue and sent the coordinates to your Terminal. A ship is also ready, and you should see it nearby.
Rover: Got it. I'm on my way.
Rover: I still don't know what the Fractsidus is planning.
Rover: But whatever it is, it definitely involves Rinascita. I'm counting on you to investigate further.
(Head to the designated location)
The Gondola sets sail from Septimont toward the far away destination.
Rover: These coordinates bring us closer to Ragunna.
Abby: Should we hit up our friends there for a hand? They might know a thing or two about this.
 It's better we handle this ourselves.
Rover: The more people involved, the more attention we might draw from the Order. Their eyes are everywhere, including on our friends.
Rover: Besides, we've seen how the Rinascitans are more vulnerable to the Threnodian's power. If they get involved, it could put them in danger.
Abby: Right... that makes sense.
Abby: Ahhh... it's all so quiet. Still no sign of the Threnodian.
Abby: Well, just holler if you need me.
 Is that...
 Fenrico...
Fenrico: Greetings, Righteous One. If unanswered questions have left you wary, allow me to guide the path before you.
 What brings you all the way here?
Fenrico: With the Divinity's blessing, I follow Their words, for I am bound to Their will.
 Your Divinity is gone.
Fenrico: Blasphemy! I see now how the faithless have led you astray, coaxing you to abandon the righteous path.
Rover: I'm not here to play games. Cut to the chase, what are you after?
Fenrico: Rinascita must be unified and purified, for only then can its people be free from fear and division.
Fenrico: As Their grace and divine will shine upon us once more, so too has Their divine power returned from the faithless lands of Septimont.
Fenrico: With this power, I will unite the divided minds and build a paradise where tears no longer fall.
Fenrico: Join me in this great cause, Righteous One. This is also a chance to rid yourself of a foe that has long plagued you.
 Who?
Fenrico: The Fractsidus.
Rover: Ah, so you and the Fractsidus can't agree on how to split the Threnodian's residual energy.
Fenrico: I serve Their will. It is the only true path.
Fenrico: As for the hubristic faithless, they deserve no salvation... nor will they obstruct my course...
 I can smell it—whose blood have you spilled?
Fenrico: Despite our shared enemy, you still choose conflict over cooperation.
Rover: Ha, I trust what I see. There is no need for me to ally with you.
(Cutscene plays)
Fenrico: You will find no escape from the storm ahead.
(Cutscene ends)
Phrolova: Such leniancy... is not your style.
 Why did you save me?
Phrolova: You're welcome.
 Answer the question.
 Where is this place?
Phrolova: The depth beyond reach, where secret treasures often hide.
 I need you alive to explain this.
Phrolova: Remember the story you experienced in Septimont? The one of the girl lost to the sea?

Phrolova: A sould in defiance of itself, its essence seeping into a brilliant Gem. It drifted here with lingering whispers of resentment.
Phrolova: Enchanted, the faithful of the deep followed its call, seeking to claim the divine power as their own.
Phrolova: This is a twisted movement in the symphony, and to play it again, your strength is necessary.
Rover: (The Threnodian's residual energy in the sea came from Mya... and it crystallized inside a Gem?)
Rover: You already know what I'm here for, don't you?
Phrolova: Nothing but this deserves your stay in such barren waters.
Phrolova: This is just the beginning. Wandering this unfamiliar sea alone will lead you nowhere, and you'll have no defense against the Order's zealotry.
Rover: Are you proposing a cooperation?
Pursuer from the Order: Thought I heard something over there!
Pursuer from the Order: Search every corner!
Rover: I'll take care of the Order's guards first, then we'll discuss the Gem's whereabouts.
Phrolova: Of course. Even if everyone here stood against you, none would truly rival your power.
Phrolova: Alas, time slips through our fingers. Were I granted the luxury, I would wait for my injuries to heal and reclaim everything myself, rather than risk it all to save you.
Phrolova: You might find the right path on your own, but listen closely... Hear those distracting footsteps? They will never cease pulling you astray.
Phrolova: By the time you finally silence the noise and find your way, what you seek may already be lost.
Phrolova: The choice is yours.
Rover: Think you can turn the tide with words alone? Nice try.
Pursuer from the Order: Nothing there!
Pursuer from the Order: What about over there?
 (Agree to cooperate.)
Phrolova: Glad you made the wise choice.
Rover: Remember, it's just for now.
 (Try to search for another way yourself.)
Phrolova: Be my guest.
(Talk to Phrolova, if cooperation refused)
Phrolova: Lost your way?
 ...
Phrolova: There is still one path you've left unturned.
 I agree.
Phrolova: Say again, please?
 I agree to work with you, for now.
Phrolova: Shall we?
Phrolova: Everything is made of frequencies. Once the melody is distorted, its rhythm is skewed. No blunt force can ever rectify it.
Phrolova: Unless one orchestrates its essence anew.
Phrolova: After you.
(Continue onward while orchestrating)
Rover: The same door again...
Phrolova: Time your moves carefully.
Phrolova: That way, you can shift its state at will.
(Head to the designated location)
Pursuer from the Order: They're here!
Pursuer from the Order: You, open that gateway...
Phrolova: Out of the question.
Rover: What's this about?
Phrolova: ...
Pursuer from the Order: Even if you don't... the Primus will be there... You'll never get the Gem...
 Fenrico wants the Gem for himself?
Pursuer from the Order: This is... the only way!
(Defeat the enemies)
Phrolova: Leave them be. They won't wake.
 How do you know?
Phrolova: Mismatched rhythms, twisted frequencies. Both are signs of the Gem's touch.
Phrolova: How vexing. After all this time chasing me, they still haven't learned to let go.
 Is that where you got your injuries?
Phrolova: I'm just surprised the Order dared to target you. I thought they'd behave before the great Laureate.
Rover: Spare me the commentary. Fenrico wants the Gem, and I intend to stop him. That's all that matters. Now, lead the way.
Phrolova: We should leave.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: ...
Phrolova: I will clear the mist and reveal the path before you.
Phrolova: The blades of ignorance and chaos are yours to shatter.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: Orchestrating here should get us through, right?
Phrolova: Yes.
(Ride the rail)
Phrolova: It will be faster this way.
Rover: Didn't expect to take this route.
Phrolova: Transport channels aren't just for goods.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: Hmm?
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: The Order has tried every possible way to block us.
Phrolova: I'm sure you've learned how to handle it by now.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: ...
Rover: What's wrong?
Phrolova: ...Nothing.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: (Why are Fractsidus members here?)
Phrolova: Finish them.
Rover: Are you sure?
Phrolova: I am.
(Defeat the enemies)
 You're stone cold.
 Why did they attack you?
Phrolova: Those ensnared by the discordant melody only strike out blindly.
Phrolova: No use to me, no reason to spare.
 Is this how our cooperation will end?
Phrolova: Why? Are you afraid?
Phrolova: There is nothing to fear. The worst that awaits is simply death.
Phrolova: When we joined the Fractsidus, we accepted that this day might come.
Phrolova: Me, them, every one. We're all the same.
Rover: Not sure if that's absolute loyalty or sheer indifference to life.
Phrolova: Indifference, you say?
Phrolova: The closer you come to death, the sharper the weight of life cuts to expose what you truly desire.
Phrolova: There.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: ...What a cacophony.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: Strange.
(Head to the designated location)
Pursuer from the Order: They're here!
Phrolova: Noisy...
Pursuer from the Order: Take them down!
(Defeat the enemies)
Leah: No—!
Aeschylus: Wake up, my love! It's me! Can't you recognize me?
Aeschylus: Phrolova, it's happening again...
Leah: It's time for the rehearsal... I don't want to go... No... Don't go...
Phrolova: I'm here.
Phrolova: I've found the way. Soon, I'll bring you all back.
Leah: Don't leave me... Take me with you...
Aeschylus: My child, no one can escape death. Let go of what we've told you. In the end, we're all bound to face it.
Aeschylus: ...And perhaps the only thing left for us is to accept it.
Phrolova: Aeschylus, over all these years, each of you has spoken to me in contradictions.
Phrolova: Words of surrender, of perseverance, of fear, of pleading...
Phrolova: Fate is fickle, ever ready to devour. Death comes swiflty, without warning...
Phrolova: ...And in its shadow, I have seen you at peace, in fear, in sorrow... and in madness.
Phrolova: But worry not, for I am here.
Phrolova: I will always be here.
Aeschylus: Phrolova, my poor child...
Phrolova: (How many times has it been? How many times has he tried to let go, only to tighten his grip again?)
Phrolova: (Life is as fragile as trembling leaves caught in winter's breath, their quiet cries swallowed by the wind.)
Phrolova: (The more fleeting, the harder to judge if our choices were ever right. To find meaning in them, one must first walk a path that stretches into "forever.")
Phrolova: (With a soul reaching toward the world's end, like mine... and like (‍his/hers‍)...)
Phrolova: (Even when lost at a crossroads, there's no need to despair. No matter how far you've gone, you can always turn back and find your way home.)
Rover: They shouldn't be here, right?
Phrolova: Yes, but given how twisted the melody is, anything could happen here.
Rover: Is this the Gem's doing?
Phrolova: It's Fenrico's.
(Open the gate)
Phrolova: We must return to the tower before Fenrico finds out.
Rover: What exactly are your people planning here?
Phrolova: My... people?
 You know this place too well, and the Fractsidus have a heavy presence here.
 Don't tell me you have nothing to do with all this.
Phrolova: Why do you care?
Phrolova: Now I'm intrigued. Tell me, if death were closing in, what would be your final thought?
Phrolova: A person? A memory? Words left unsaid? Or perhaps, regrets too late to mend?
 That's not your concern.
 You still haven't answered my question.
Phrolova: Ah, that look. You thought of something just now. A desire unfulfilled, yet still haunting you.
Phrolova: But what if I told you that even the most irreversible fates could "start over"?
 Start over?
Phrolova: Ah, how careless of me... I forget I'm speaking to someone who chose to wipe their own past...
Phrolova: Here, we shall witness the advent of the Lost Beyond.
Phrolova: A land of serenity, harmony, and perfection... A sphere beyond the reach of time... A new world never to be marred by tragedy.
 You mean a Sonoro Sphere?
Phrolova: How crude. That name strips it of its poetry and warmth.
Phrolova: I composed it, not by note. And within the tower, it opened its arms to the world for the first time.
Phrolova: It is my chance to mend what was broken, to fulfill every wish I could never make true.
Phrolova: Yet for the Lost Beyond to truly endure, for its melody to bring joy, it still needs a divine "texture."
 The Gem.
Phrolova: Yes. Only with the texture can each movement resonate in perfect harmony. Only then will this new symphony truly come to life.
Phrolova: But Fenrico smothered its first breath before it could even cry out. I won't let him twist its melody to serve his own ends.
 Where's the Gem now?
Phrolova: Deep within the Lost Beyond.
Phrolova: With the last of my strength, I cast it into the depths and sealed the gateway leading to the tower.
Phrolova: If I cannot claim it, no one shall.
 If it's hidden in the Lost Beyond, why are you worried?
Phrolova: Sealing an entire realm drained my power. When my strength failed, the Order's betrayal was no longer a mere sting, but a blade, heavy and sharp.
Phrolova: But with every strike, I saw things more clearly... Yes, I could not resist the pull of the next blade.
Phrolova: But I cannot fall. The immortal Divinity within grows and writhes. It will not remain caged forever behind that gateway.
Phrolova: The Lost Beyond will return.
Rover: So you're saying the Order might get to the Gem before us?
Rover: Without the full picture, I can't trust you so easily.
Phrolova: Heh, trust...
Phrolova: How absurd, to speak of trust between us.
Phrolova: There is only one Gem.
Phrolova: No matter how this unfolds, we'll see which of us walks away with what they desire.
Rover: Where should we go next?
Phrolova: This path is a shortcut, but difficult to pass through.
Phrolova: That one takes longer, but may be smoother.
Phrolova: In truth, either will take us...
 The shortcut, then. I'll handle whatever comes.
 Don't act like my choice doesn't matter to you.
Phrolova: Heh... if you insist.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: Fenrico wanted to keep this place under wraps. There may be more to it than meets the eye.
Phrolova: Let's take a look up ahead.
Phrolova: There shouldn't be any interference from here on out.
Phrolova: A harmonious tune shall unveil the path forward.
Phrolova: But along the seabed, the melodies have been distorted, tangled beyond recognition.
Phrolova: Restoring them will take time.
(Ride the current)
Phrolova: Steel yourself for the twisted hymn.
Rover: How do you know what lies ahead?
Phrolova: The area before us is vital to the Order. Fenrico wouldn't leave it lightly guarded.
Phrolova: Ready your blade.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: More guards, just like you said.
Phrolova: They're all yours.
(Start the fight)
Rover: The frequencies of these Order Echoes feel unnatural.
Phrolova: The Order created them. They know how to warp them just as easily.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: What is this place?
Phrolova: It is where the Order of the Deep crafts Common Echoes.
 Are we supposed to pass through here?
Phrolova: Yes. The Orchestration Altar is there.
Phrolova: However...
 What's the problem?
Phrolova: Keep your eyes sharp. The mist is another trap they've set for us.
Rover: So let's avoid it. Which way is faster?
Phrolova: The left one.
Rover: ...
Phrolova: Still in doubt?
Rover: The right one seems closer and safer.
Phrolova: Suit yourself.
 (Take the left way.)
 (Take the right way.)
(Head to the designated location, if decided to go right)
Rover: (This way's blocked, and the rail's out of order. Looks like I'll have to go left after all.)
(Talk to Phrolova, if decided to go right)
Phrolova: See, doubt made the hand on the dial move two more ticks.
Rover: ...
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: This is...
Phrolova: Remember, the essence of all things can be altered.
(Head to the designated location)
 What are those?
Phrolova: Echo Brooders.
 What's their purpose?
Phrolova: To create Rinascita's Common Echoes from the twisted fragments of Tacet Discords and Echoes.
Phrolova: Born in chaos, yet shaped to be amiable and useful. How interesting.
Phrolova: A touch of vibrancy woven into ruin, an opus of life that lasts for an eternity...
Phrolova: The art of reshaping frequencies is far more fluid than one might think.
Phrolova: And... brimming with vitality.
(Defeat the enemies)
 How did you know they would emerge?
Phrolova: I heard the restless discordance.
 Sharp ears... I didn't catch a thing.
Phrolova: There are whispers that reach me beyond these...
???: (It hurts... Phrolova... I don't want to be here...)
???: (Take us away... Only you... Only you can...)
???: (Don't leave us... Don't leave us here...)
Phrolova: (...)
Phrolova: ...
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: We should be able to take the rail here, right?
Phrolova: Hm? Ah, wait a moment, I'll activate it first.
(Ride the rail)
Rover: (She clearly drifted off just now. What was that about?)
Rover: (Is this... really the right path?)
Rover: (I need to stay sharp and quickly get a handle on this place to be sure of my way forward.)
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: (...)
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: If I time it right, the way forward might reveal itself.
(Idle)
???: Phrolova, it's time to go home for dinner! Your parents must be waiting for you!
(Ride the rail)
Leah: Careful now, my child. Watch your step.
Phrolova: Time to switch the rail.
Rover: Got it.
Rover: (She seemed to have just noticed it... strange.)
(Defeat the enemies)
Leah: Phrolova, you're back.
Aeschylus: You don't look well, child. Did something happen?
Phrolova: Nothing to worry about. (‍He/She‍) will take care of it.
Phrolova: I heard your murmurs just now... You didn't seem this frightened the last time we met, Leah.
Leah: Frightened? Heh, nothing gets under my skin at this age.
Phrolova: What about... death?
Leah: Ah, now there's a true demon. Always unwelcome, always reminding you of the shortness of our days and the regrets we can't mend.
Leah: How I'd love for this merry life to last forever, for things to never change, and for no one to take their leave.
Triss: That's not right! If I've fulfilled my one true purpose, then death could never scare me!
Melissa: Oh, not this nonsense again, Triss! Come on, dinner's ready!
Melissa: Phrolova, it's time to go home for dinner! Your parents must be waiting for you!
Phrolova: My parents... waiting for me...
Aeschylus: Haha, Triss's words remind me of myself fifty years ago. Wouldn't you say, Leah?
Leah: Aye, she spends far too much time with you...
Phrolova: What do you think now?
Aeschylus: Now? I just want to watch a few more sunrises with my Leah.
Phrolova: My, my. I thought the meticulous Rover was supposed to be flawless in battle.
 And I thought you would never doze off before an enemy.
Phrolova: ...A crack has appeared on that gateway.
Phrolova: This one also needs...
Rover: I'll activate it.
(Ride the rail)
Rover: How did you know the gateway had cracked?
Phrolova: I felt the disharmony within the Lost Beyond.
Rover: That was fast...
Phrolova: How pathetic that most will overlook the smallest of fractures... but for now, time remains on our side.
(Ride the rail)
Phrolova: Almost there.
Rover: Just like before, you'll handle the Orchestration.
Phrolova: Mmm.
(Orchestrate)
Phrolova: The melody has returned to its proper rhythm. This place is beginning to restore itself.
Phrolova: Soon, it will recover too.
Luneau: I knew we'd make beautiful music together! Another perfect rehearsal!
Triss: Hold on, you played ahead of the beat. I heard it!
Luneau: Ahem... Well, Phrolova, your playing and Triss's improvisation were completely in sync! No wonder you're our best violinist!
Phrolova: It's only because... I've played this piece countless times before.
Triss: Oi! Don't be changin' the subject now!
Noemie: I've heard tell you've been asked to perform far from here? I'm sure you'll amaze them all, just like you always do.
Phrolova: That performance...
Triss: Are you alright, Phrolova? You look a bit pale....
Phrolova: Plans have changed, but it's nothing to worry about.
Triss: I see... When you can, come back and rest, will you? You've been workin' so hard!
Triss: I remember you said this is the only place you could truly rest. But you're always busy, and sometimes things here get a bit... messy.
Phrolova: I'm here with you.
Phrolova: Triss, do you want me to keep going with my plan?
Triss: Of course! I wanna sing and sing forever!
Phrolova: Even though this isn't the home we once knew?
Triss: I know it's not. I'm not the same as I was either. I died in an accident, hundreds of years ago.
Triss: But I still feel me inside, and I can still laugh and sing. It doesn't feel any different.
Triss: I know you can do it, Phrolova. You'll bring everyone back, and I'll be right here waitin' for ye. I'll wait for that day.
Triss: By then...
Phrolova: By then, you will stand on an even brighter stage.
Phrolova: (I'll be here. "Always.")
Phrolova: This time... Will death be real...?
Phrolova: Am I... finally going back...?
???: But you can't, Phrolova. You can't simply die. Didn't you promise to bring them home?
???: Phrolova... Phrolova... Wake up...
Rover: Phrolova... Phrolova!
Rover: Losing that much blood and not even trying to treat it... If you really wanted to die, I could've made it quicker for you.
Rover: You deliberately teeter on the verge of death. Are you that desperate to see what you truly desire?
Phrolova: ...
Phrolova: We should move.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: An audio recording here.
Reporting Acolyte: Primus, Phrolova has reached the final stage.
Fenrico: The foundation of the Paradise is complete. It is time to purge those who have strayed.
Fenrico: The souls trapped in darkness need a temporary dwelling. For that, we need her work.
Reporting Acolyte: But Primus...
Fenrico: You hesitate. Why?
Reporting Acolyte: This is... different from what you told us.
Reporting Acolyte: You said our goal was to return the divine power within the Gem to the holy sphere. You never mentioned this part.
Reporting Acolyte: Has the plan changed?
Fenrico: ...
Reporting Acolyte: Primus? Should I continue the recording?
Fenrico: Recording... When did I ever... I see. No, continue recording.
Rover: Fenrico's goal isn't just the Gem.
Phrolova: Or, more precisely, this man of authority has already sunk deep into the mire of his own confusion.
Rover: (This feels a lot like what Cantarella described before.)
Rover: (Is the Threnodian's power driving him toward something?)
 Why did you create the Lost Beyond?
Phrolova: ...
Phrolova: Because... I made a promise long, long ago.
Phrolova: A long-lost friend once told me that every promise matters. Once you make one, you see it through, no matter the cost.
 How long is "long, long ago"...
Phrolova: Well, nothing like what you'd call "long ago," I suppose.
 But you're still human.
Phrolova: And?
 Maybe it's about keeping a promise. Or maybe it's your own stubbornness.
Phrolova: Heh...
Rover: Resonance abilities are tied to emotions. If your stubbornness drove you to create an entire Sonoro, then I'd call it an obsession.
Phrolova: Perhaps.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: Finally, some peace.
Rover: You mean...
Phrolova: The chaotic melodies, the distorted hymns, the clamor of life's rhythm... Everything we left behind was nothing short of a disastrous symphony.
Rover: If that's the case, can I expect the path ahead to be different?
Phrolova: Perhaps the lake ahead remains undisturbed.
(Head to the designated area)
Rover: This is far from undisturbed.
Phrolova: It seems the chaos has seeped into every corner of the Fabricatorium...
 Need to orchestrate it then?
Phrolova: Yes. The Orchestration Altar is behind that pillar.
 The water's not deep. Maybe we could walk it through.
Phrolova: Water? It's the energy source that keeps this site running.
Phrolova: Hold on. I'll orchestrate this area first. Let's see if the path will reveal itself after the mist is cleared.
Rover: (She's trying to use her Forte again... and she looks better now. Her injuries and Resonance ability are recovering.)
Rover: (Our alliance hings on her weakened state. I'm not sure how long it'll take for her to fully recover... but when she does, this fragile pact could end in an instant.)
???: If this world can't be changed, then maybe it's time to take a different path... even if it's nothing like before.
???: I'll do whatever it takes to help you achieve your goal. We stand in the same place, and I've already shown you that what you seek is within reach.
Phrolova: (It's... possible...?)
Rover: Phrolova.
Phrolova: This mist... It's even thicker than before.
Phrolova: And...
Rover: Things are getting worse in the Lost Beyond?
Rover: The Sonoro Sphere you created seems to be tied to your life.
Phrolova: A sharp observation.
Phrolova: Worry not. It won't affect our goal.
Phrolova: There is always a way forward. Stay close.
(Investigate the Echo Brooder
Phrolova: Look at this.
Rover: Some kind of sheet music? It looks similar to what we saw back at the Altar.
Phrolova: They are different movements of the same composition. Only when they are all orchestrated can the piece return to its original harmony.
 What is this composition for?
Phrolova: As I mentioned, everything is made of frequencies. Melodies can bend the rhythm of existence, and by orcherstrating their essence, we reshape their very nature.
Rover: So all this chaos was caused by Fenrico disrupting the composition?
Phrolova: Exactly.
Phrolova: This piece is the heartbeat of this entire place. Restore it, and order will return. The pathways between regions will open again.
 You composed this piece, didn't you?
Phrolova: You... recognize this melody?
Rover: No, but I can tell. You were working with them, right?
Phrolova: ...
Phrolova: Of course, you're right.
 Did you leave any backdoors, just in case?
Phrolova: If I didn't, we wouldn't have made it this far.
Phrolova: However... this piece shoul dhave been on the Orchestration Altar, but now it's hidden in this Echo Brooder...
 Good. We can fix them all at once.
Phrolova: ...It won't be that simple.
(Try to put in the music pieces)
Phrolova: As expected... two movements are missing. Despicable.
 There was only one at the place we just passed.
Phrolova: Then there is only one other place they could be.
Phrolova: They are right beneath our feet.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: It's a mess here. How are we supposed to find the movement pieces?
Phrolova: Try to think from the perspective of the one who concealed them.
(Ride the rail)
Phrolova: We'll descend from here. The path ahead should be safe.
Rover: Safe, really?
Phrolova: ...I didn't expect this either.
Rover: Echo Brooders, in here?... Stay on guard, just in case they break out and attack.
Phrolova: They won't. They're not fully developed yet.
Phrolova: ...
Rover: Oh? What was that you said?
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: We should each go our own way.
 You want to act alone?
Phrolova: Fenrico likely hid the two music sheets separately to stall us.
Phrolova: You're wondering if this was all a setup to trap you.
 I can't be sure what's happening in the Lost Beyond.
 The timing is too convenient.
Phrolova: Heh... Now I'm even more certain. Fenrico wanted us separated.
Phrolova: If he could craft a snare for us to walk into, why wouldn't he?
Phrolova: Searching together wastes time, but if we're separated, the fragile trust between us could crumble in an instant.
Phrolova: Doubt, dispute, hesitation... such ruinous trappings follow us disquietly to our graves. That's his plan.
Phrolova: But I won't let him win. Will you?
 What do you mean by this?
Phrolova: It's tied to my power and the only support I have in my weakened state.
Phrolova: Even if we're apart, you'll still hold my fate in your hand.
 You'd trust me with this?
Phrolova: Staying here will get neither of us what we want.
Phrolova: Don't keep me waiting.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: An ambush?
Rover: Ha, as expected.
(Defeat the enemies)
Rover: Pointless.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: This device looks the same as the ones I saw earlier.
Rover: We can adjust the water level and get out from the passage above.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: It's a bit tricky without a guide...
Abby: Not if I'm here!
Rover: Did you sleep well?
Abby: Mhm! Feeling great!
Abby: But where are we now? So many twists and turns, it's making me dizzy...
Rover: Let's figure this out together.
Abby: Roger! Roger!
(Head to the designated location)
Abby: Hah, that wasn't so tough. See? We made it out.
Rover: You were about to pass out.
Abby: No way! Something like that ain't ever taking me down.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: Come on, we need to find the music piece.
Abby: What music piece?
Rover: It's a long story...
Abby: Alright then, I'll keep an eye out. Just make sure you fill me in later!
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: Why are there so many Tacet Discords?
Rover: She can't defend herself. We need to clear the way for her.
Abby: Wait, why would you even... Ugh, whatever. Maybe try poking these control devices?
(Activate the device)
Abby: Look, this can take care of them!
(Help Phrolova out of danger)
Rover: She's probably safe for now. Let's go.
(Head to the designated location)
Abby: Check out all this stuff! We might find the music piece here.
(Read the file)
Rover: "The frequencies in Retroact Rain are essentially purer and more stable Remnant Energy. This shows potential."
Rover: "The human consciouscness retained within the rain is too weak, resulting in only brief, repetitive fragments."
Rover: "Retroact Rain is unpredictable and cannot independently form Tacet Discords or Echoes capable of maintaining human consciousness on a large scale. Research terminated. Recorder: Phrolova."
(Read the file)
Rover: "Tacet Discords generated by the Dark Tide consist of fragmented frequencies intensely fused together."
Rover: "These subjects lack self-awareness. The collective consciousness formed through fusion is entirely shaped and controlled by Leviathan."
Rover: "The Dark Tide cannot sustain or preserve original human consciousness. Research terminated. Recorder: Phrolova."
(Read the file)
Rover: "Artificial Sonoro Spheres have a short duration and are unstable. Additionally, the influence of Fortes can cause unintended changes to them."
Rover: "Creating a large, stable Sonoro capable of sustaining a reality for all, would entail significant costs. Additionally, the process would demand the sustained application of my Resonance ability."
Rover: "This research direction has gained solid support and will contiue. Recorder: Phrolova."
Rover: These records all link to the Waveworn Phenomenon.
Abby: Why did Phrolova even study this?
Rover: There's a pattern here... She was searching for a way to preserve human consciousness.
Rover: And if Fenrico's recording is real, who exactly was she trying to save when she created the Lost Beyond?
Abby: Are these guys guarding something?
Rover: Looks like the music piece is nearby.
Abby: Huh? Is that Phrolova?
Rover: She's talking to someone... but I can't tell who.
Rover: Anyway, let's keep going.
(Obtain the music piece)
Rover: Here it is. We should bring it back.
Abby: Back? What do you mean?
 We need to rendezvous with Phrolova.
Abby: I don't know what's going on between you two, but maybe you should do this yourself.
 Why?
Abby: Her frequency smells... off.
Rover: Off?
Rover: It's safer for you to stay in my Tacet Mark and keep watch. This place is unstable, and the Threnodian is still at work.
Abby: Copy that. Be careful out there.
Phrolova's perspective.
(Head to the designated area)
Phrolova: I didn't expect you to act...)
(Head to the designated area)
Phrolova: (More guards... and watchful eyes...)
Phrolova: (I must find another way.)
(Head to the designated area)
Phrolova: (Heh... The more watchful the eyes, the louder their fear sings to me.)
(Head to the designated area)
Phrolova: (There. My way out.)
Phrolova: (When the melody beckons, their eyes may turn away... and in the hush, the shadow slips through.)
Phrolova: (Well then... Show me how you conduct your symphony.)
(Destroy the device)
Phrolova: (Shall we let the music begin?)
(Activate the device)
"Triss": Phrolova, in a bit of trouble, hmm?
Phrolova: Don't show yourself with her face, Grand Architect.
"Triss": Oh? But you used to like it when "I" was like this.
Phrolova: Why are you here?
"Triss": "I" promised you, didn't I? To let the Elegy from the Beyond sing here, and see "us" reborn again.
"Triss": The frequency in your eye... It hurts, doesn't it? So many voices, so many cries, all echoing in your head...
"Triss": "I" know you can bear it, just like you always have. With your half-human, half-Tacet Discord body, can anything even hurt you, or kill you? But your mind? I don't want you to feel all that pain.
"Triss": And now... the game has changed. After what happened in Septimont, Augusta's made her move.
Phrolova: "Disdaining fortune, with Its power clutched in our grasp before Its fall, we shall wield It, and call forth every forgotten soul." That was your promise to me.
Phrolova: But without Leviathan's power of Unity, I can no longer grant them all a rebirth within the Beyond.
"Triss": Oh, but you still can. You're saving "us" now!
"Triss": "I" just want you to finish Cristoforo's plan first.
"Triss": The seabed is in chaos. Now isn't the best time to bring "us" back.
"Triss": Merging Reverberations with Tacet Discords, keeping "our" consciousness alive while creating new vessels for "us"... Don't you want more time to make it perfect? A true revival, done the right way?
Phrolova: Even if I agree to help you first, (Rover) would never allow it. (‍He/She‍) would fight to the end to stop us.
"Triss": The Beyond is merging with you. Once you gain the strength to open that gateway, you can keep (‍him/her‍) there. With "us." Forever.
Phrolova: ...
"Triss": Oh? You're hesitating. Is that moment you two shared really more important than "us"?
Phrolova: You misunderstand. A seat in the Beyond has always awaited (‍him/her‍). Trapping (‍him/her‍) now changes nothing. In the end, (‍he/she‍) will fulfill (‍him/her‍) promise to me there.
"Triss": Hehehe... Hurry up, Phrolova. The Beyond is holding onto you tighter and tigther. I'm scared you won't have much time left.
???: The stars never blink... The sun never sets...
???: When can we leave?
???: No, I can't do it... I can wait, but when can we...
Phrolova: (Silence. I need silence...)
???: Phrolova, when this piece is truly complete, I'll come back.
???: Is that a promise?
???: Yes. No matter where I am, I'll return.
???: Every promise matters. Once I make one, I'll see it through, no matter the cost.
Welcoming Neighbor: Phrolova, don't forget! We're off to the neighboring city tomorrow!
Curious Audience: Phrolova, could you tell us the story behind that tune you're conducting?
Close Friend: Phrolova, we made a promise. Friends forever, through thick and thin. Neither of us will ever leave the other behind.
Pessimistic Scholar: Phrolova, Reverberations from human death are destined to disperse or distort. If they become Tacet Discords, they're no longer human.
Phrolova: What I couldn't do back then... I can make happen now...
Phrolova: Your bones will no longer be marrowless. Your blood will no longer be cold...
Distressed Family Member: Phrolova, keep living... We long to be by your side...
Relieved Tutor: Phrolova, I've faith that the melody you weave with your baton will change the world one day...
Phrolova: Yes, it will...
Phrolova: The world is but a symphony of resonating frequencies. Human may fall to be Tacet Discords, and Tacet Discords may rise again as humans... There is no divide between us.
Phrolova: I have long erased that line. So can everyone else.
Phrolova: (When did she come?)
Phrolova: (That chaos clouded my mind. Did I just...)
Energy Safety System: Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Engaging intercept protocol.
Energy Safety System: Target location locked. Initiating Eradication sequence.
Rover: Am I orchestrating the right way?
Phrolova: ...You have a talent for it.
Energy Safety System: Target location updated. Entering Advanced Eradication Mode.
Energy Safety System: Detecting frequent target location updates. Entering Super Advanced Eradication Mode.
Rover: We can't take the elevator. We need another way up.
Phrolova: Then let's make the quake spread further, shall we?
Rover: Did you touch something? What caused the explosion?
Phrolova: Fenrico tied the music piece to the security system.
Rover: Heh. He'd blow up all the energy here just to stop us. He's really putting everything into this.
Phrolova: May he enjoy the music we prepared for him.
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: Here, as we agreed.
You return Phrolova's baton to her.
Rover: Can you still orchestrate?
Phrolova: Of course.
After a short deliberation, Phrolova hands you all the music pieces.
Phrolova: I'll leave the rest of the Orchestration to you.
 Why?
Phrolova: "Are the changes here truly coming from the shifts in the melody?"
Phrolova: "Are there hidden plans woven into pieces?"
Phrolova: For all your little doubts...
Phrolova: Taking the conductor's baton yourself is the only way you'll believe in what's unfolding here.
Phrolova: And that's how we move forward.
 Alright, I'll wrap up the Orchestration then.
(Leave the area)
Rover: I bet Fenrico never imagined these pipelines would en dup making our lives easier.
Phrolova: This place depends on them to transport energy across the site.
Rover: Pipelines to transport energy... that means more noticeable frequency fluctuations around them, huh?
Phrolova: Exactly.
Rover: We should be landing around the Gem's location, right?
Phrolova: Correct.
Rover: From what the Order's pursuers said, Fenrico will have his men guarding it.
Phrolova: Even the most unpredictable story will one day welcome its conclusion. And when that moment comes, we must act.
Phrolova: That will also be the time when you can turn your blade against me.
Rover: This wasn't part of the plan, was it?
Phrolova: No. Someone interfered. I've never been here before.
Rover: Then we'd better find a way out quickly.
(Talk to the Acolyte)
Guiding Acolyte: Dear brothers and sisters, you who stand before us shall be an irreplaceable force in Rinascita's salvation.
Guiding Acolyte: Let us join together to spread light to all, and face the Divine Ordeal in unity.
 Are you one of Fenrico's Acolytes?
Guiding Acolyte: Come, join us! Offer your prayers to the holiest sacred land!
Guiding Acolyte: Amidst your endless research, do not forsake your faith! Never forget! They are always watching!
Rover: (There's no light in their eyes. Just emptiness... and blind devotion.)
Phrolova: These fanatics can give you no answers.
Rover: Why are there so many ensnared Acolytes here?
Rover: Let's check out what's happening.
Phrolova: Agreed.
(Talk to the Acolyte)
Guarding Acolyte: Brothers and sisters, if your resolve is firm, step forward. The sacred pilgrimage awaits.
Guarding Acolyte: Remember! Only the devoted shall receive Their blessings.
 These Acolytes seem more fervent than the last group.
Phrolova: To find the exit, we must play along.
Phrolova: How about a simple disguise, dear Acolyte?
 Let's do it.
 Give me more time.
Respectful Acolyte: O great Sentinel. Please grant us mercy for our sins.
Respectful Acolyte: O forgiving Sentinel. Grant us serenity.
Respectful Acolyte: O Sentinel of ages. Make us whole.
Respectful Acolyte: O forgiving Sentinel. Grant us serenity.
Respectful Acolyte: O great Sentinel. Please grant us mercy for our sins.
Respectful Acolyte: O Sentinel of ages. Make us whole.
Devout Acolytes: How do we lead people to worship You?
Devout Acolytes: We guide them closer to Your boundless grace.
Devout Acolytes: How do we lead people to believe in You?
Devout Acolytes: We let them touch Your very soul.
Devout Acolytes: Come closer.
Devout Acolytes: Reach out your hand.
Devout Acolytes: Until you walk with Them.
Rover: There's an inscription on the altar.
Rover: "I am no longer Them. I will lead the people forward."
Rover: Imperator's statue is gone... Is this Fenrico's ambition?
Rover: The next line reads...
Rover: "It reminds us that the Sentinel walks with us, illuminating our path with wisdom."
Rover: The Sentinel... Could this lantern be the very one Napoli the Second used? The one imbued with the Sentinel's power that allowed him to repel the Dark Tide?
Rover: (That lantern wasn't real... Where am I?)
Rover: (Where's Phrolova?)
Phrolova: He wants to trap us here forever.
Rover: Phrolova?
Phrolova: I'm here. Do what I say.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: Take the red gate.
(Take the red gate)
Rover: Was that reality or an illusion...?
Phrolova: Does it matter? Let's move forward.
(Investigate the Orchestration Altar)
Rover: Is this another Orchestration Altar? It looks different from the one before.
Phrolova: The principles should be the same.
Rover: I'll check the surroundings for clues while you handle the Orchestration. It'll be faster that way.
Phrolova: Sure.
(Investigate the file)
The Divinity must be whole.
No matter where the divine power scatters, I shall lead it back.
I will pursue Their enemies until every fragment of the divine power is reclaimed to the Paradise, where the consciousnesses of people shall dwell securely.
When the Divinity returns, it shall be the day we walk toward unity and light once more.
Phrolova: Perfect timing.
Rover: Wait, we just unlocked something.
Rover: I'd really like to see what secret is kept in such a place.
(Investigate the file)
Why do I forget? Is it the erosion of time, or some deeper failing? I must inscribe these secrets. I must remember:

The Dark Tide descending from the sky is the Divine Ordeal. It is born from the shadows of our hearts, twisting faith to fuel its unjust force of destruction.
This unfathomable darkness has long shackled the Ragunnesi's subconscious mind, blinding them to the true righteous path.
On this journey of survival, the weight of the martyrs' sacrifices has become unbearable.
People cannot perceive what lies beyond their own consciousness. Yet I, who have glimpsed the truth, must use external force to restore the Ragunnesi to their true and complete selves.
From among the faithful, a powerful Harbinger shall arise, bringing both life and annihilation from the Dark Tide into this world.
Only by striking down this Harbinger, by descending into the depths of the darkness and using Their power to merge all the trapped souls into my own body, can I lead them all away from the Dark Tide.
The safe, undisturbed Lost Beyond shall be our new sanctuary. There, these souls shall find rest.
When tens of thousands of restored spirits unite as one to form a fortress of unshaken faith, believing together that it shall not come, then it will cease to exist.
Unity is our sole deliverance from the Divine Ordeal. Should the path falter, remember, "The Lantern" endures. It will guideyou to the true light.
Rover: ("Unity is the sole deliverance from the Divine Ordeal." That's why Fenrico fought to keep Ragunna from falling into discord.)
Rover: (The record says darkness has long shackled the Ragunnesi's subconscious. Only by defeating this Harbinger, descending into the depths of darkness, and bringing back all trapped souls can the Dark Tide be resisted...)
Rover: (So that's why he's after the Gem and the Beyond. He intends to use them to house the Ragunnesi's subconscious and fend off the Dark Tide.)
Rover: (The Acolytes we encountered... They were probably the martyrs who tried and failed.)
Rover: (...Could he really have come up with this solution entirely on his own?)
Rover: (Gathering everyone's consciousness and keeping them in some sanctuary...)
Rover: (But when I compare this to the information I found before, the handwriting is the same, but the viewpoints contradict each other.)
Rover: (That recording I found earlier also mentioned Fenrico giving conflicting orders to the Acolytes at times.)
Rover: (He doesn't strike me as indecisive. He must've noticed these inconsistencies himself. That's why he left these notes and the lantern, as reminders to himself.)
Rover: (What other force is at play here? THe path of salvation he's chosen might not be as perfect as he thinks...)
Rover: From among the faithful, a powerful Harbinger shall arise, bringing both life and annihilation from the Dark Tide into this world.
Rover: This Harbinger... Who does that refer to?
Phrolova: I don't know. Nor do I care.
Rover: ...
Rover: Alright, let's move on. There's an opening below. We might find a way out there.
(During the fight)
(Cutscene plays)
Phrolova: O sinful dream, why do you disturb this tranquil slumber?
Phrolova: The weeping child lingers no more.
Phrolova: Instead, she raises her hand and claims that vaporous drop.
(Cutscene ends)
Rover: (Phrolova's gone.)
Rover: (Did she use the teleport to cut and run, or...)
Rover: (No point dwelling on that. It won't change anything. I need to keep moving.)
Rover: (Are they the Order's Echoes? What are they searching for...?)
Rover: (Could this be the Lost Beyond Phrolova mentioned?
Rover: (Did she open the gateway here because she sensed the Order's intrusion?)
Rover: (It seems they haven't found the Gem yet. I'll take them down first.)
(Head to the designated location)
Rover: (Where am I? It doesn't look like anywhere in Rinascita...)
Rover: (It's inhabited. Let's take a closer look.)
(Head to the designated location)
Noemie: Is it quite far from here? How long will the journey take?
Leah: Well now... I can't say for sure.
Luneau: Ah, sure, as long as the bags are packed, it should go smoothly enough.
Aeschylus: Phrolova, you're here!
Leah: Did you forget something, dear?
Aeschylus: Ah, you brought the violin we gifted you! Play it with all your heart, won't you? You bet we'll be cheering!
Luneau: Take our music to the grandest of stages. I can't wait to see how the crowd takes to it!
Phrolova: Let's have one last rehearsal when I return.
Triss: Phrolova, I brought you some pastries! Have 'em on the road.
Triss: But don't you get crumbs on your dress! You've got to look just as stunning as the others at the concert!
Phrolova: Alright, alright! I hear you!
Melissa: Oh, you look so beautiful today. I wish I could capture this moment for you...
Phrolova: Thank you, Melissa, for dressing me up.
Melissa: Actually... your mother prepared it.
Melissa: She never really minded your performance, not deep down. She's just upset cause you've never been so far from her before.
Melissa: And promise us now, don't be causin' us worry. Let us know you've made it there safely, okay?
Phrolova: ...I will. And I'll bring back the applause when I return. On that day, I'll stand by her side, apologize, and tell her everything.
Phrolova: But for now... Mrs. Leah, it's time to set out!
Rover: Excuse me, is Phrolova going to a concert?
Triss: Sorry, who are you?
Rover: I've come looking for a Gem.
Leah: A Gem? What are you talking about?
Rover: Maybe Phrolova knows.
Phrolova: Me? I've never heard of it... Sorry, but you must have the wrong person. We haven't met before, have we?
Rover: (...What? She thinks we've never met?)
Leah: Alright, no time to dawdle! We should head off now!
Rover: (No one here knows about the Gem... I should look elsewhere.)
(Optional - Talk to Searle)
Searle: Rote practice is an essential part of studying music. If you do not master the fundamentals, you cannot create great pieces.
Searle: I shall inform your parents if you ever skip class again!
Searle: Sigh... Kids are getting harder to teach by the year. Just look at you all...
Samp: And look at Phrolova, only a few years older, and yet she's doing extra practice. She even plays me music she writers herself.
Samp: Yes, we know, Ms. Searle. You've told us a million times already!
Denali: Yeah, no matter how hard we try, we don't have her talent...
Searle: Well, I don't expect you to be exceptional, I simply want you all to... Hang on. Caleres, where is your textbook?
Caleres: Lost.
Searle: Lost! That textbook belongs to Phrolova. I borrowed it from her for you so you could read her notes in the margins! Go find it!
Searle: Urgh! I'm seeing red...

I saw triss again!
I now have a direction, a new anchor.
Maintaining this balance of using each other is the best outcome.
Rover: (The attempts recorded here line up with the research notes Phrolova left behind.)
Rover: (...Could this be her home?)
Rover: (The friend she mentioned meeting at the concert... That person must be very important to her.)
Rover: (But what does "a new anchor" mean? Who is she using... and who is using her?)
???: None shall stop... the final cadenza...
Rover: Phrolova?
Rover: (That was her voice, I'm sure of it... But why can't I reach her?)
Rover: (I won't find any more answers here. I should check somewhere else.)
(Head out of the house)
Rover: (Why are there so many Tacet Discords now...?)
Rover: (Where is everyone? Are they hiding in their homes?)
(Head to the designated location)
"Leah": Did you... forget something...
"Aeschylus": RUN! Run... This place will soon be devoured...
 (Tacet Discords that can talk, but don't attack humans?)
"Leah": We can't escape... No...
 What are you talking about?
 What are you running from?
"Triss": Let's... practice... the performance... Yummy...
Rover: (Why do these Tacet Discords sound like the people from earlier...?)
Rover: (Could they... be one and the same?)
Rover: (It can't be possible... They looked indistinguishable from real people. I didn't notice anything off at all...)
Rover: (Wait, Phrolova said there's no divide between humans and Tacet Discords, and their frequencies could merge.)
Rover: (Merge...)
Rover: (I see now...)
Rover: (She wants to use the Gem to fuse the bodies of Tacet Discords with human consciousness, bringing them back to life. She's trying to fulfill the desire that's always haunted her.)
Rover: (That's... insane.)
Rover: (Given their unstable nature, these Reverberations have never truly become human again...)
(Head to the designated location)
???: Why do you keep alone?
 Phrolova?
"Phrolova": Of what sorriest thoughts do your companions make, clinging to what should have died with them?
"Phrolova": All life in this world... has already died...
"Phrolova": No, this isn't irreversible. I won't simply succumb to it.
"Phrolova": I searched everywhere... but why can't I find it?
"Phrolova": Tell me... have you found it?
 Found what?
"Phrolova": My violin...
 Violin...?
"Phrolova": My ambition. My companion. The most precious Gem among all that I have...
"Phrolova": I can't lose it... But where could it be? It must be waiting for me.
 (The most treasured Gem?)
"Phrolova": I won't leave without it.
 (Looks like this place isn't entirely under her control...)
 (Could that violin be a sign she left behind?)
(Head to the designated location)
(Cutscene plays)
(Cutscene ends)
Concert Hall Manager: Phrolova, this is your debut in this city. Are you sure about this? Taking the stage in a dress of mourning... and playing an elegy?
Phrolova: I am certain.
Phrolova: I want my melody to sink into the very bones of this earth, so that they hear my return, loud and clear.
Concert Hall Manager: ...Alright. I respect your decision. Time's almost up. I'll inform the orchestra.
(Enter the door)
Phrolova: The Blessed Maiden, unable to fully govern herself, still becomes a thread in your grand tapestry.
Phrolova: Manipulating reality behind her back, reviving the Threnodian's lingering power within her through the progression of a tale... That's now nearly impossible.
Cristoforo: Ah, but at the very least, we have affirmed her resilience and stability after the merging. That alone offers invaluable insight into our research sample.
Cristoforo: If we allow the story to unfold, we may have the chance to further destabilize Cartethyia and mold her into the Threnodian.
Phrolova: Do you not hear (Rover) on our heels? And you're willing to gamble everything on a mere "chance" to deliver what the Grand Architect desires?
Cristoforo: Heh, so eager to witness the Beyond's completion at the seabed.
Phrolova: Why not nudge Septimont's plot just a little? Use your original plan to mask our true purpose.
Phrolova: The Resonator's Second Awakening, the attempts to merge with the Divinities... These are but advancements for individuals. Why not place our wager on ordinary souls instead? The moment is ripe.
Cristoforo: Worry not. Whatever the Grand Architect promised for your plan, I've already accepted. Your actions aren't at odds with our ultimate goal.
Cristoforo: We need only ensure that the Threnodian's lingering power remains firmly within our grasp.
Cristoforo hands the script he holds to "you."
(Enter the door)
Fenrico: The two Divinities have been entwined for centuries. To sever Them is no simple task.
Phrolova: Without Them, the Lost Beyond will fail to take its destined form.
Fenrico: Their power is bound to faith. Only by deepening the people's beliefs can we ensure a successful separation of the Divinities.
Fenrico: Yet, I have devoted much time assisting with your endeavor. Tell me, what will you offer in return?
Phrolova: Primus Fenrico, there's no need for pretense before me. You have already gained much from this grand design, have you not?
Phrolova: Speak freely. What is it that you desire?
Fenrico hands "you" a guest list for the Carnevale.
Fenrico: Travelers from far and wide, a grand celebration upon us... Such a convergence invites chaos, and I fear for Ragunna's stability.
Phrolova: Heh, I see your concern. Very well, allow me to lend a hand.
Phrolova: ...
Fenrico: Oh? Are these outsiders also intolerable to you?
Phrolova: No. I simply noticed a new variable on the list.
Phrolova: Perhaps, this is no misfortune at all. If my understanding is correct, no one would be more determined to sever those two "Divinities" than (‍him/her‍).
Phrolova: (‍He/She‍) may be the final cadenza heralding a new chapter for this world.
(Enter the door)
Scar: The Threnodian's awakening has slowed. Could the Midnight Rangers have caused this?
Phrolova: Soft cries will never command its attention.
Phrolova: The ceaseless tolling of funerall bells, the restless wails of lost souls... How could it continue its slumber?
Phrolova: It's only a matter of time before its eyes open.
Scar: Oh? So, (‍he/she‍)'s made her move.
Phrolova: No wonder...
Scar: (‍He/She‍)'s in Gorges of Spirits. Care to witness it firsthand?
Phrolova: No need. FOr now, (‍he/she‍) has nothing to offer me.
Phrolova: I will remain here and listen to what the "people" have to say.
Scar: Hmm... Staying behind to merge Reverberations with the Tacet Discords' bodies? Don't you need Leviathan's power for that?
Phrolova: Just a few simple orchestrations. I alone will sufice.
Phrolova: What Leviathan shall carry is all that stands behind me.
Scar: Hah. Well then, I'll go see what this big shot is really made of.
Phrolova: Don't understimate (‍him/her‍). Excessive improvisation will disrupt the original composition. You do remember your task, don't you? What we seek lies in the depths of Jinzhou.
(Start the performance)
(Cutscene plays)
Triss: Hey! Phrolova's back!
Aeschylus: How were your performance? All smooth, I hope?
Luneau: Look over there! What's that?
Phrolova: Triss... Melissa... Granny Leah...
(Cutscene ends)
(Optional - Interact with the audience)
Curious Audience: Ms. Phrolova, mind sharing the story behind that piece you conducted?
Curious Audience: I hear there's been talk about some ancient, forbidden compositions discovered recently, supposedly written by a musician who shared your name.
Curious Audience: Wouldn't you know, there are all sorts of strange rumors about those pieces.
Curious Audience: Word is, they were so depressing they'd drag anyone already on edge right down to despair. They were condemmed as luring people to their ruin... That's why they disappeared from history, they say.
Curious Audience: So, any chance this composer might be related to you?
Phrolova: An interesting story, sir. Unfortunately, interesting stories aren't of concern to someone like me.
(Optional - Interact with the audience)
Excited Audience: The music you conducted was sensational! It was so graceful and ethereal! Every note was pure magic, striking deep into the soul!
Excited Audience: I was so lucky to attend this concert. Ms. Phrolova, I'm already one of your biggest admirers!
Phrolova: Thank you.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: You didn't clap.
Rover: Perhaps a silent mourning is more suitable for such a depressing piece.
Phrolova: You're the first to say you've found sorrow in it.
Rover: So, what were you mourning for?
Phrolova: For... the fragility of life? The tribulation of survival?
Rover: That's too general. The sorrow it conveyed is more than that.
Phrolova: What makes you think that?
Rover: It felt uniquely authentic. Like it came from something real.
Phrolova: Do you know how this concert hall came to be?
Phrolova: It was built upon the remains of an ancient town.
Rover: An ancient town?
Phrolova: Yes, an insignificant one. A tiny grain of sand in the long course of history.
Phrolova: No divine blessings. No kindly fate. Only desperate hands clinging to life. Despite their struggle, this town was swallowed by a disaster, erased along with the entire civilization in the blink of an eye.
Phrolova: Those good people's lives expired before the flowers in their caps, dying before they sickened.
Phrolova: And the land beneath our feet turned to ashes, bereft of its former laughter and joy.
Phrolova: Sighs? Groans? Shrieks that rend the air? No, nothing. That was the way the world ended. Not with a bang but a whisper.
Phrolova: However...
Phrolova: For some reason, one person survived.
Phrolova: She drifted through the ruins, searching for signs of life, only to find none. On and on she walked, yet no matter how far she strayed, she could never escape that pit of death.
Phrolova: Tell me, do you think this lone survivor suffered more than the dead?
Rover: Maybe...
Phrolova: Beneath this concert hall lies the story that gave birth to this melody. I wove her burden into the composition to release it for her.
Phrolova: I still remember the words she could never let go of, "Why is our world like this?"
 This pain might be the seed of a new hope.
Phrolova: What do you mean?
Rover: If this world can't be changed, then maybe it's time to take a different path... even if it's nothing like before.
Rover: Just like how I chose to change myself.
Phrolova: You changed yourself? What kind of change was that?
 I started over.
Phrolova: Hmm, that sounds intriguing.
Phrolova: I wonder if each of us can change in that way...
Phrolova: I've gained more than I imagined from this performance.
 I'm lucky I heard such a good piece of music.
Phrolova: But it's still not good enough. I want to include the voices of the past, making that history a true part of it.
 When this piece is truly complete, I'll come back.
Phrolova: Is that a promise?
 Yes. No matter where I am, I'll return.
 Every promise matters. Once I make one, I'll see it through, no matter the cost.
Phrolova: Alright, I'll be waiting for you then. I'll save you a VIP seat next time. Besides, I also want to hear more stories about how you "started over."
Phrolova: "This tour led me to a friend. (‍He/She‍) understood the true emotions woven into my music..."
Rover: (So the friend she mentioned...)
Rover: (Was it me?)
Rover: (And the one she's been waiting for... is also me?)
Rover: (No, that doesn't seem right. Did I really meet at this concert?)
Rover: (It could've been an illusion she created on purpose, not something that really happened...)
Rover: (With the Gem at stake, this could be her attempt to throw me off...)
Devoted Watcher: I hope this special day brought you happiness.
(Head to the designated location)
Phrolova: Thank you. I'm happy. This reunion is an unexpected surprise.
"Triss": Today was just grand! We sailed together, watched a play, and even had our own little concert by the road!
Phrolova: Yes... It was just like the old days.
"Triss": Phrolova, did you notice...
"Triss": How many people... were cheering... for us...
Devoted Watcher: I'm sorry, but I cannot let her remain for too long.
Phrolova: I once bowed before the divine, a servant in its name, offering my faith in return for those I loved. Yet the divine remained silent, watching as fools took my abilities as a free elixir.
Phrolova: I once sought science, surrendering my own flesh and blood to prove resurrection was more than a dream. But I was deceived, used as a mere material in their pursuit of immortality.
Phrolova: I once turned to the people, asking if the Waveworn Phenomenon had ever cradled life. But I was cursed, branded a harbinger of doom by the terrified.
Phrolova: So I begged no more. I sought in silence. Again and again, failure upon failure, loss upon loss.
Phrolova: Until today. Until you let me see Triss.
Devoted Watcher: A fleeting moment, yes. But this is only the beginning.
Devoted Watcher: You seek to "start over," don't you? Then make full use of your power. Survive. Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn the power of humans.
Devoted Watcher: Make her last longer than she did yesterday. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. Time will creep forward, to the last syllable of recorded time. Until the day she's more real, more joyful than ever before.
Devoted Watcher: Until the day Leah drives you to another concert. Until the day old Aeschylus rehearses by your side once more.
Devoted Watcher: Until the day...
Devoted Watcher: You voice the apology you denied your mother all these years.
Devoted Watcher: Even a fragile civilization deserves the right to grow. And you, Phrolova, will be the beacon of that hope.
Devoted Watcher: The road ahead will be long. Grueling. Such is the nature of any righteous cause.
Devoted Watcher: Fear not. We will walk it with you. The resources, the knowledge, the technology, all will be yours.
Devoted Watcher: You have met the others. Though our pasts differ, our goal remains one and the same.
Phrolova: Then from this moment on, I walk with you.
Phrolova: I will spend endless years. I will pay the heaviest price. I will silence all distractions. I will wield everything at my disposal to bring back the light.
???: Welcome to the Fractsidus.
Phrolova: You're too sharp.
Rover: A shift in melody means a change. That's what you taught me.
Phrolova: You're truly one to leave mixed emotions.
 You're fully recovered, aren't you?
Rover: From operating the Orchestration mechanism, to wielding Tacet Discords at will, to opening the gateway to the Beyond by yourself...
Rover: It seems that your recovery is in sync with the merging between you and the Beyond.
Phrolova: And yet, there's no reason for you to raise your blade against me. Not now. The Gem is no longer in the Beyond. If we are to retrieve it from Fenrico, we must work together.
 After you just tried to trap me?
Phrolova: The modulated melody failed to play its part. And so once again, the choice is yours.
Rover: That piece... Did I really hear it before?
Phrolova: Whether it's real or not, it changes nothing.
Phrolova: That is...
Phrolova: Hurry.
(Head to the designated location)
(Cutscene plays)
Fenrico: I am the first, yet shall be the servant of all.
Rover: Is that... the Dark Tide?
Phrolova: It didn't work...
Fenrico: I remain here to guide the lost and bring true peace to Ragunna.
(Cutscene ends)
Rover: Fenrico can summon the Dark Tide creations?
Rover: "From among the faithful, a powerful Harbinger shall arise, bringing both life and annihilation from the Dark Tide into this world..."
Rover: He's the Harbinger!
(Head to the designated location)

Phrolova: The Gem's power grows.
Fenrico: Salvation, Ascension, and Unity. This will be the one true path.

Fenrico & Leviathan: The faithful shall not falter. By faith shall their souls be preserved.
Fenrico & Leviathan: Thou shalt walk in my statues and keep mine ordinances.
(During the fight)
Fenrico & Leviathan: Hark, O breath of the winds! Bow thee down and yield, ye lost souls!
(Fenrico at low HP)
(Cutscene plays)
Rover: Fenrico, stop! The Threnodian is using you! You are the Habringer of the Dark Tide!
Fenrico: Absurd! I stand against it. How could I ever be its puppet?
Fenrico: O Sentinel! Return the souls in darkness to this world! Let all wills be made one!
Phrolova: The Gem... is fleeing into the Dark Tide?
(Cutscene ends)
Fenrico: My predecessors... What you taught... I...
Fenrico: "The path born of injustice must be fortified with further transgressions..."
Fenrico: Hah, no, even with the body perished, hope and salvation shall endure.
Fenrico: Righteous One, please, save Rinascita's souls from the Paradise...
Rover: Your plan won't work.
Phrolova: Says the one who hasn't witnessed the years, the failures, the countless attempts I've made. What gives you the audacity to pass such judgment?
Rover: You've already tried everything! Can't you see? The path you're on only leads here, nowhere beyond.
Phrolova: Among thousands of paths, surely one will lead me back to them.
Phrolova: And even if I'm wrong... I fear not starting over. I've done it time and time again.
Rover: What meaning is there in chasing something that's neither realistic nor attainable?
Phrolova: I know they're there.
 I saw them in the Beyond.
Rover: Those fading Reverberations did not, and cannot, return to life. No matter how long you hold onto their frequencies, the result will be the same.
Rover: The villagers are dead. What you've created are Tacet Discords. If you continue turning the entire town into that... you're not creating a paradise. You're creating a hell.
Phrolova: "The villagers are dead..."
Phrolova: So, you saw them in their human form.
 ...
Phrolova: Then how can you claim my goal is unattainable?!
 Your goal is the one the Fractsidus gave you.
Rover: It's what they forced on you. And the Triss you saw? Fleeting, unstable, an illusion. And yet, you still believe everything they say can become real?
Phrolova: The Fractsidus showed me a way forward.
Phrolova: Even if they have their own motives, even if we're only using each other... I care not.
Phrolova: If they can help me take this step, then another step may follow. And another. No matter how steep the price, I'll pay it, step by step, until I reach the end I seek.
Phrolova: Love? Sincerity? Compassion? Trust?
Phrolova: What you and your cronies hold dear is but a jest to the Fractsidus. No bond lasts forever. Without true loyalties, there can be no betrayal, no deceit.
Phrolova: I no longer buy into such illusions.
Phrolova: After all, even if you believe with all your heart, even if you wait patiently at a crossroads...
Phrolova: The one you're waiting for may have long since forgotten you. Forgotten the promise they swore to keep.
Phrolova: I waited. For a long time.
Phrolova: I won't wait anymore.
Phrolova: What was once an unforgettable encounter between us can now be the thread that weaves a paradise for "them."
Rover: You've gone too far.
Phrolova: Heh, you're one to talk. How amusing.
Phrolova: You, with your long life and its endless possibilities, still choosing to start over, even at the cost of all your memories?
Phrolova: The irreplaceable bonds, the emotions that make us human, are the brightest lights and most precious treasures in our fragile existence.
Phrolova: What madness, what cruelty, what impossible goal could drive you to cast them all aside?
Phrolova: You've gone further than I ever could.
Phrolova: Perhaps you believe more than I do that only in endless time can true, eternal perfection arise.That only then will a brave new world arrive.
Phrolova: We walk different paths, yet in the end, we are both driven by the same madness. Why argue over who's fallen further?
Phrolova: The only difference is that... you've forgotten it all.
Rover: You never understood the true value of human life.
Phrolova: Nor have you stepped beyond the bondary that death has placed upon the human soul.
 Our cooperation ends here.
Phrolova: Hehe...
Phrolova: ...
Phrolova: So, this is our finale.
(Cutscene plays)
Phrolova: I'm sorry.
Phrolova: I've come home.
(Cutscene ends)
Rover: (Fenrico spoke of a... Paradise. What does it mean?)
Rover: (And "save Rinascita's souls"... Was he pointing to the source of the anomaly in Rinascita?)
Fenrico: I heard curses... not loud, but deep... I deserve them.
Fenrico: Soon, It will gather enough strength to herd the people and drown Rinascita beneath the Dark Tide.
 Fenrico?
Fenrico: The Gem isn't the true heart of the problem. The falst Journeying Paradise has created an illusion of everlasting peace, hiding the real source of the catastrophe.
 What will you do?
Fenrico: I will remain here to stem the Dark Tide's spread.
Fenrico: Now, I can sense it clearly. The fluctuations from the Paradise are not in Ragunna, but in Septimont...
Fenrico: I cannot reach that far. I must rely on you to go, find, and solve the crisis there. Only then can those who abandoned their faith save their homeland.
Abby: Phew, that was exhausting...
Abby: I can't believe it! That gate sent me to some lab so, so far away!
Abby: Finally made it back... So? What happened after that? Did we win?
 The Fractsidus got away with the Gem.
Abby: What? What should we do now? Let's track them down!
 Not now. There's something more important.
Abby: Huh? What's the bigger deal?
Rover: We were after the Gem to find the source of the anomaly in Rinascita.
Rover: Now we have a better lead—the Journeying Paradise.
Rover: That might also explain why the Fractsidus took the Gem and what they're really after.
Rover: We'll head to Septimont to uncover the truth.
Rover: Maybe it's time we spoke with the Ephor.
Abby: Oh... Alright. Are we heading back now?
 We still have to tie up loose ends here.
"Once I dreamt that we were dear to each other."
"I woke to find that we were strangers."
(Quest Complete)
(Optional - Approach the entrance to the Lost Beyond)
Abby: Achoo! Hmm... The smell here is kinda weird...
 This must be the entrance to the Lost Beyond.
Abby: Wait, it feels alive.
 Alive?
Abby: I know that sounds odd... but I mean, whatever's on the other side is pulsing along to the beats of someone's life!
Abby: It's kinda faint, btu it's definitely part of a person's frequency!
 Phrolova...
Abby: Hey, what was that thing you were holding? It smelled exactly the same as this place.
Rover: You mean her baton?
Rover: It seems like the Beyond has now completely merged with her.
Rover: If you can feel the pulse of life in the Beyond, it means she's still alive...
Abby: Okay, I just gave the place a good sniffin'! Only some leftover energy. Nothing smells wrong.
 If we go in there, will she know?
Abby: Hmm... maybe? It's kinda like we're walking right into someone's thoughts!
 Since it's harmless, we'll leave it be for now.
 Let's go in and take a look.
Glossary
Dark Tide - A Waveworn Phenomenon unique to Rinascita, the Dark Tide is a manifestation of the Threnodian Leviathan's power of Unity. Dark clouds amass overhead and crash down like a waterfall, surging in all directions. Wherever the Dark Tide spreads, it spawns Tacet Discords and scars the land with Tidal Blight. At its epicenter, a new Tacet Field forms.
Echo Brooder - A device for incubating Common Echoes. Twisted, shattered Echo frequencies are reconstructed into new Common Echoes within its chamber.
Fabricatorium of the Deep - A secluded underwater experiment facility built by the Fractsidus and the Order, where they both pursue hidden ambitions under the guide of Common Echo reprocessing and production.
Harbinger - Humans selected by the Threnodian Leviathan to spread its doctrine, and sow sorrow and despair among the masses. Influence appears to be a key factor in their selection. Marked by the Dark Tide's corruption, they wield fragments of Leviathan's power, such as summont Its creations.
Retroact Rain - High-density Remnant Energy from the Etheric Sea that projects past events with uncanny fidelity. The Retroact Rain unfolds in three distinct phases: natural descent, near-ground suspension, and reverse flow.
